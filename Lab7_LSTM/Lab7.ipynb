      "\n",
      "The Nellie, a cruising yawl, swung to her anchor without a flutter of\n",
      "the sails, and was at rest. The flood had made, the wind was nearly\n",
      "calm, and being bound down the river, the only thing for it was to come\n",
      "to and wait for the turn of the tide.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sea-reach of the Thames stretched before us like the beginning of\n",
      "an interminable waterway. In the offing the sea and the sky were welded\n",
      "together without a joint, and in the luminous space the tanned sails\n",
      "of the barges drifting up with the tide seemed to stand still in red\n",
      "clusters of canvas sharply peaked, with gleams of varnished sprits. A\n",
      "haze rested on the low shores that ran out to sea in vanishing flatness.\n",
      "The air was dark above Gravesend, and farther back still seemed\n",
      "condensed into a mournful gloom, brooding motionless over the biggest,\n",
      "and the greatest, town on earth.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Director of Companies was our captain and our host. We four\n",
      "affectionately watched his back as he stood in the bows looking to\n",
      "seaward. On the whole river there was nothing that looked half so\n",
      "nautical. He resembled a pilot, which to a seaman is trustworthiness\n",
      "personified. It was difficult to realize his work was not out there in\n",
      "the luminous estuary, but behind him, within the brooding gloom.\n",
      "\n",
      "Between us there was, as I have already said somewhere, the bond of\n",
      "the sea. Besides holding our hearts together through long periods of\n",
      "separation, it had the effect of making us tolerant of each other's\n",
      "yarns--and even convictions. The Lawyer--the best of old fellows--had,\n",
      "because of his many years and many virtues, the only cushion on deck,\n",
      "and was lying on the only rug. The Accountant had brought out already a\n",
      "box of dominoes, and was toying architecturally with the bones. Marlow\n",
      "sat cross-legged right aft, leaning against the mizzen-mast. He had\n",
      "sunken cheeks, a yellow complexion, a straight back, an ascetic aspect,\n",
      "and, with his arms dropped, the palms of hands outwards, resembled an\n",
      "idol. The director, satisfied the anchor had good hold, made his way\n",
      "aft and sat down amongst us. We exchanged a few words lazily. Afterwards\n",
      "there was silence on board the yacht. For some reason or other we did\n",
      "not begin that game of dominoes. We felt meditative, and fit for nothing\n",
      "but placid staring. The day was ending in a serenity of still and\n",
      "exquisite brilliance. The water shone pacifically; the sky, without a\n",
      "speck, was a benign immensity of unstained light; the very mist on the\n",
      "Essex marsh was like a gauzy and radiant fabric, hung from the wooded\n",
      "rises inland, and draping the low shores in diaphanous folds. Only the\n",
      "gloom to the west, brooding over the upper reaches, became more sombre\n",
      "every minute, as if angered by the approach of the sun.\n",
      "\n",
      "And at last, in its curved and imperceptible fall, the sun sank low, and\n",
      "from glowing white changed to a dull red without rays and without heat,\n",
      "as if about to go out suddenly, stricken to death by the touch of that\n",
      "gloom brooding over a crowd of men.\n",
      "\n",
      "Forthwith a change came over the waters, and the serenity became less\n",
      "brilliant but more profound. The old river in its broad reach rested\n",
      "unruffled at the decline of day, after ages of good service done to the\n",
      "race that peopled its banks, spread out in the tranquil dignity of a\n",
      "waterway leading to the uttermost ends of the earth. We looked at the\n",
      "venerable stream not in the vivid flush of a short day that comes and\n",
      "departs for ever, but in the august light of abiding memories. And\n",
      "indeed nothing is easier for a man who has, as the phrase goes,\n",
      "“followed the sea” with reverence and affection, than to evoke the\n",
      "great spirit of the past upon the lower reaches of the Thames. The tidal\n",
      "current runs to and fro in its unceasing service, crowded with memories\n",
      "of men and ships it had borne to the rest of home or to the battles\n",
      "of the sea. It had known and served all the men of whom the nation is\n",
      "proud, from Sir Francis Drake to Sir John Franklin, knights all, titled\n",
      "and untitled--the great knights-errant of the sea. It had borne all the\n",
      "ships whose names are like jewels flashing in the night of time, from\n",
      "the _Golden Hind_ returning with her rotund flanks full of treasure, to be\n",
      "visited by the Queen's Highness and thus pass out of the gigantic tale,\n",
      "to the _Erebus_ and _Terror_, bound on other conquests--and that never\n",
      "returned. It had known the ships and the men. They had sailed from\n",
      "Deptford, from Greenwich, from Erith--the adventurers and the settlers;\n",
      "kings' ships and the ships of men on 'Change; captains, admirals, the\n",
      "dark “interlopers” of the Eastern trade, and the commissioned “generals”\n",
      " of East India fleets. Hunters for gold or pursuers of fame, they all\n",
      "had gone out on that stream, bearing the sword, and often the torch,\n",
      "messengers of the might within the land, bearers of a spark from the\n",
      "sacred fire. What greatness had not floated on the ebb of that river\n",
      "into the mystery of an unknown earth!... The dreams of men, the seed\n",
      "of commonwealths, the germs of empires.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sun set; the dusk fell on the stream, and lights began to appear\n",
      "along the shore. The Chapman light-house, a three-legged thing erect\n",
      "on a mud-flat, shone strongly. Lights of ships moved in the fairway--a\n",
      "great stir of lights going up and going down. And farther west on the\n",
      "upper reaches the place of the monstrous town was still marked ominously\n",
      "on the sky, a brooding gloom in sunshine, a lurid glare under the stars.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And this also,” said Marlow suddenly, “has been one of the dark places\n",
      "of the earth.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He was the only man of us who still “followed the sea.” The worst that\n",
      "could be said of him was that he did not represent his class. He was a\n",
      "seaman, but he was a wanderer, too, while most seamen lead, if one may\n",
      "so express it, a sedentary life. Their minds are of the stay-at-home\n",
      "order, and their home is always with them--the ship; and so is their\n",
      "country--the sea. One ship is very much like another, and the sea is\n",
      "always the same. In the immutability of their surroundings the foreign\n",
      "shores, the foreign faces, the changing immensity of life, glide past,\n",
      "veiled not by a sense of mystery but by a slightly disdainful ignorance;\n",
      "for there is nothing mysterious to a seaman unless it be the sea itself,\n",
      "which is the mistress of his existence and as inscrutable as Destiny.\n",
      "For the rest, after his hours of work, a casual stroll or a casual spree\n",
      "on shore suffices to unfold for him the secret of a whole continent,\n",
      "and generally he finds the secret not worth knowing. The yarns of seamen\n",
      "have a direct simplicity, the whole meaning of which lies within the\n",
      "shell of a cracked nut. But Marlow was not typical (if his propensity\n",
      "to spin yarns be excepted), and to him the meaning of an episode was not\n",
      "inside like a kernel but outside, enveloping the tale which brought it\n",
      "out only as a glow brings out a haze, in the likeness of one of these\n",
      "misty halos that sometimes are made visible by the spectral illumination\n",
      "of moonshine.\n",
      "\n",
      "His remark did not seem at all surprising. It was just like Marlow.\n",
      "It was accepted in silence. No one took the trouble to grunt even; and\n",
      "presently he said, very slow--“I was thinking of very old times, when\n",
      "the Romans first came here, nineteen hundred years ago--the other day\n",
      ".... Light came out of this river since--you say Knights? Yes; but\n",
      "it is like a running blaze on a plain, like a flash of lightning in the\n",
      "clouds. We live in the flicker--may it last as long as the old earth\n",
      "keeps rolling! But darkness was here yesterday. Imagine the feelings\n",
      "of a commander of a fine--what d'ye call 'em?--trireme in the\n",
      "Mediterranean, ordered suddenly to the north; run overland across the\n",
      "Gauls in a hurry; put in charge of one of these craft the legionaries--a\n",
      "wonderful lot of handy men they must have been, too--used to build,\n",
      "apparently by the hundred, in a month or two, if we may believe what we\n",
      "read. Imagine him here--the very end of the world, a sea the colour\n",
      "of lead, a sky the colour of smoke, a kind of ship about as rigid as a\n",
      "concertina--and going up this river with stores, or orders, or what you\n",
      "like. Sand-banks, marshes, forests, savages,--precious little to eat\n",
      "fit for a civilized man, nothing but Thames water to drink. No Falernian\n",
      "wine here, no going ashore. Here and there a military camp lost in\n",
      "a wilderness, like a needle in a bundle of hay--cold, fog, tempests,\n",
      "disease, exile, and death--death skulking in the air, in the water, in\n",
      "the bush. They must have been dying like flies here. Oh, yes--he did\n",
      "it. Did it very well, too, no doubt, and without thinking much about\n",
      "it either, except afterwards to brag of what he had gone through in his\n",
      "time, perhaps. They were men enough to face the darkness. And perhaps he\n",
      "was cheered by keeping his eye on a chance of promotion to the fleet at\n",
      "Ravenna by and by, if he had good friends in Rome and survived the awful\n",
      "climate. Or think of a decent young citizen in a toga--perhaps too\n",
      "much dice, you know--coming out here in the train of some prefect, or\n",
      "tax-gatherer, or trader even, to mend his fortunes. Land in a swamp,\n",
      "march through the woods, and in some inland post feel the savagery, the\n",
      "utter savagery, had closed round him--all that mysterious life of the\n",
      "wilderness that stirs in the forest, in the jungles, in the hearts of\n",
      "wild men. There's no initiation either into such mysteries. He has to\n",
      "live in the midst of the incomprehensible, which is also detestable. And\n",
      "it has a fascination, too, that goes to work upon him. The fascination\n",
      "of the abomination--you know, imagine the growing regrets, the longing\n",
      "to escape, the powerless disgust, the surrender, the hate.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He paused.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mind,” he began again, lifting one arm from the elbow, the palm of the\n",
      "hand outwards, so that, with his legs folded before him, he had the\n",
      "pose of a Buddha preaching in European clothes and without a\n",
      "lotus-flower--“Mind, none of us would feel exactly like this. What saves\n",
      "us is efficiency--the devotion to efficiency. But these chaps were not\n",
      "much account, really. They were no colonists; their administration was\n",
      "merely a squeeze, and nothing more, I suspect. They were conquerors, and\n",
      "for that you want only brute force--nothing to boast of, when you have\n",
      "it, since your strength is just an accident arising from the weakness of\n",
      "others. They grabbed what they could get for the sake of what was to\n",
      "be got. It was just robbery with violence, aggravated murder on a great\n",
      "scale, and men going at it blind--as is very proper for those who tackle\n",
      "a darkness. The conquest of the earth, which mostly means the taking\n",
      "it away from those who have a different complexion or slightly flatter\n",
      "noses than ourselves, is not a pretty thing when you look into it too\n",
      "much. What redeems it is the idea only. An idea at the back of it; not\n",
      "a sentimental pretence but an idea; and an unselfish belief in the\n",
      "idea--something you can set up, and bow down before, and offer a\n",
      "sacrifice to....”\n",

      "He broke off. Flames glided in the river, small green flames, red\n",
      "flames, white flames, pursuing, overtaking, joining, crossing each\n",
      "other--then separating slowly or hastily. The traffic of the great city\n",
      "went on in the deepening night upon the sleepless river. We looked on,\n",
      "waiting patiently--there was nothing else to do till the end of\n",
      "the flood; but it was only after a long silence, when he said, in\n",
      "a hesitating voice, “I suppose you fellows remember I did once turn\n",
      "fresh-water sailor for a bit,” that we knew we were fated, before\n",
      "the ebb began to run, to hear about one of Marlow's inconclusive\n",
      "experiences.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don't want to bother you much with what happened to me personally,”\n",
      " he began, showing in this remark the weakness of many tellers of tales\n",
      "who seem so often unaware of what their audience would like best to\n",
      "hear; “yet to understand the effect of it on me you ought to know how I\n",
      "got out there, what I saw, how I went up that river to the place where I\n",
      "first met the poor chap. It was the farthest point of navigation and the\n",
      "culminating point of my experience. It seemed somehow to throw a kind\n",
      "of light on everything about me--and into my thoughts. It was sombre\n",
      "enough, too--and pitiful--not extraordinary in any way--not very clear\n",
      "either. No, not very clear. And yet it seemed to throw a kind of light.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I had then, as you remember, just returned to London after a lot of\n",
      "Indian Ocean, Pacific, China Seas--a regular dose of the East--six years\n",
      "or so, and I was loafing about, hindering you fellows in your work and\n",
      "invading your homes, just as though I had got a heavenly mission to\n",
      "civilize you. It was very fine for a time, but after a bit I did get\n",
      "tired of resting. Then I began to look for a ship--I should think the\n",
      "hardest work on earth. But the ships wouldn't even look at me. And I got\n",
      "tired of that game, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now when I was a little chap I had a passion for maps. I would look for\n",
      "hours at South America, or Africa, or Australia, and lose myself in all\n",
      "the glories of exploration. At that time there were many blank spaces on\n",
      "the earth, and when I saw one that looked particularly inviting on a map\n",
      "(but they all look that) I would put my finger on it and say, 'When\n",
      "I grow up I will go there.' The North Pole was one of these places, I\n",
      "remember. Well, I haven't been there yet, and shall not try now. The\n",
      "glamour's off. Other places were scattered about the hemispheres. I\n",
      "have been in some of them, and... well, we won't talk about that. But\n",
      "there was one yet--the biggest, the most blank, so to speak--that I had\n",
      "a hankering after.\n",
      "\n",
      "“True, by this time it was not a blank space any more. It had got filled\n",
      "since my boyhood with rivers and lakes and names. It had ceased to be\n",
      "a blank space of delightful mystery--a white patch for a boy to dream\n",
      "gloriously over. It had become a place of darkness. But there was in it\n",
      "one river especially, a mighty big river, that you could see on the map,\n",
      "resembling an immense snake uncoiled, with its head in the sea, its\n",
      "body at rest curving afar over a vast country, and its tail lost in the\n",
      "depths of the land. And as I looked at the map of it in a shop-window,\n",
      "it fascinated me as a snake would a bird--a silly little bird. Then I\n",
      "remembered there was a big concern, a Company for trade on that river.\n",
      "Dash it all! I thought to myself, they can't trade without using some\n",
      "kind of craft on that lot of fresh water--steamboats! Why shouldn't I\n",
      "try to get charge of one? I went on along Fleet Street, but could not\n",
      "shake off the idea. The snake had charmed me.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You understand it was a Continental concern, that Trading society; but\n",
      "I have a lot of relations living on the Continent, because it's cheap\n",

      "\n",
      "“I am sorry to own I began to worry them. This was already a fresh\n",
      "departure for me. I was not used to get things that way, you know. I\n",
      "always went my own road and on my own legs where I had a mind to go. I\n",
      "wouldn't have believed it of myself; but, then--you see--I felt somehow\n",
      "I must get there by hook or by crook. So I worried them. The men said\n",
      "'My dear fellow,' and did nothing. Then--would you believe it?--I tried\n",
      "the women. I, Charlie Marlow, set the women to work--to get a job.\n",
      "Heavens! Well, you see, the notion drove me. I had an aunt, a dear\n",
      "enthusiastic soul. She wrote: 'It will be delightful. I am ready to do\n",
      "anything, anything for you. It is a glorious idea. I know the wife of a\n",
      "very high personage in the Administration, and also a man who has lots\n",
      "of influence with,' etc. She was determined to make no end of fuss to\n",
      "get me appointed skipper of a river steamboat, if such was my fancy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I got my appointment--of course; and I got it very quick. It appears\n",
      "the Company had received news that one of their captains had been killed\n",
      "in a scuffle with the natives. This was my chance, and it made me the\n",
      "more anxious to go. It was only months and months afterwards, when I\n",
      "made the attempt to recover what was left of the body, that I heard the\n",
      "original quarrel arose from a misunderstanding about some hens. Yes,\n",
      "two black hens. Fresleven--that was the fellow's name, a Dane--thought\n",
      "himself wronged somehow in the bargain, so he went ashore and started to\n",
      "hammer the chief of the village with a stick. Oh, it didn't surprise\n",
      "me in the least to hear this, and at the same time to be told that\n",
      "Fresleven was the gentlest, quietest creature that ever walked on two\n",
      "legs. No doubt he was; but he had been a couple of years already out\n",
      "there engaged in the noble cause, you know, and he probably felt the\n",
      "need at last of asserting his self-respect in some way. Therefore he\n",
      "whacked the old nigger mercilessly, while a big crowd of his people\n",
      "watched him, thunderstruck, till some man--I was told the chief's\n",
      "son--in desperation at hearing the old chap yell, made a tentative jab\n",
      "with a spear at the white man--and of course it went quite easy between\n",
      "the shoulder-blades. Then the whole population cleared into the forest,\n",
      "expecting all kinds of calamities to happen, while, on the other hand,\n",
      "the steamer Fresleven commanded left also in a bad panic, in charge of\n",
      "the engineer, I believe. Afterwards nobody seemed to trouble much\n",
      "about Fresleven's remains, till I got out and stepped into his shoes. I\n",
      "couldn't let it rest, though; but when an opportunity offered at last to\n",
      "meet my predecessor, the grass growing through his ribs was tall enough\n",
      "to hide his bones. They were all there. The supernatural being had not\n",
      "been touched after he fell. And the village was deserted, the huts gaped\n",
      "black, rotting, all askew within the fallen enclosures. A calamity\n",
      "had come to it, sure enough. The people had vanished. Mad terror had\n",
      "scattered them, men, women, and children, through the bush, and they had\n",
      "never returned. What became of the hens I don't know either. I should\n",

      "as a desert, and opened the first door I came to. Two women, one fat and\n",
      "the other slim, sat on straw-bottomed chairs, knitting black wool. The\n",
      "slim one got up and walked straight at me--still knitting with downcast\n",

      "you would for a somnambulist, stood still, and looked up. Her dress was\n",

      "Ough! A door opened, a white-haired secretarial head, but wearing a\n",
      "compassionate expression, appeared, and a skinny forefinger beckoned me\n",
      "into the sanctuary. Its light was dim, and a heavy writing-desk squatted\n",
      "in the middle. From behind that structure came out an impression of pale\n",
      "plumpness in a frock-coat. The great man himself. He was five feet\n",
      "six, I should judge, and had his grip on the handle-end of ever so many\n",

      "\n",
      "“They were dying slowly--it was very clear. They were not enemies, they\n",

      "shadows of disease and starvation, lying confusedly in the greenish\n",
      "gloom. Brought from all the recesses of the coast in all the legality\n",
      "of time contracts, lost in uncongenial surroundings, fed on unfamiliar\n",
      "food, they sickened, became inefficient, and were then allowed to crawl\n",
      "away and rest. These moribund shapes were free as air--and nearly as\n",
      "thin. I began to distinguish the gleam of the eyes under the trees.\n",
      "Then, glancing down, I saw a face near my hand. The black bones reclined\n",
      "at full length with one shoulder against the tree, and slowly the\n",
      "eyelids rose and the sunken eyes looked up at me, enormous and vacant,\n",
      "a kind of blind, white flicker in the depths of the orbs, which died out\n",
      "slowly. The man seemed young--almost a boy--but you know with them it's\n",
      "hard to tell. I found nothing else to do but to offer him one of my good\n",
      "Swede's ship's biscuits I had in my pocket. The fingers closed slowly\n",
      "on it and held--there was no other movement and no other glance. He had\n",
      "tied a bit of white worsted round his neck--Why? Where did he get it?\n",
      "Was it a badge--an ornament--a charm--a propitiatory act? Was there any\n",
      "idea at all connected with it? It looked startling round his black neck,\n",
      "this bit of white thread from beyond the seas.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Near the same tree two more bundles of acute angles sat with their legs\n",
      "drawn up. One, with his chin propped on his knees, stared at nothing,\n",
      "in an intolerable and appalling manner: his brother phantom rested its\n",
      "forehead, as if overcome with a great weariness; and all about others\n",
      "were scattered in every pose of contorted collapse, as in some picture\n",
      "of a massacre or a pestilence. While I stood horror-struck, one of these\n",
      "creatures rose to his hands and knees, and went off on all-fours towards\n",
      "the river to drink. He lapped out of his hand, then sat up in the\n",

      "“I didn't want any more loitering in the shade, and I made haste towards\n",
      "the station. When near the buildings I met a white man, in such an\n",
      "unexpected elegance of get-up that in the first moment I took him for\n",
      "a sort of vision. I saw a high starched collar, white cuffs, a light\n",
      "alpaca jacket, snowy trousers, a clean necktie, and varnished boots. No\n",
      "hat. Hair parted, brushed, oiled, under a green-lined parasol held in a\n",
      "big white hand. He was amazing, and had a penholder behind his ear.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I shook hands with this miracle, and I learned he was the Company's\n",
      "chief accountant, and that all the book-keeping was done at this\n",
      "station. He had come out for a moment, he said, 'to get a breath of\n",
      "fresh air. The expression sounded wonderfully odd, with its suggestion\n",
      "of sedentary desk-life. I wouldn't have mentioned the fellow to you at\n",
      "all, only it was from his lips that I first heard the name of the\n",
      "man who is so indissolubly connected with the memories of that time.\n",
      "Moreover, I respected the fellow. Yes; I respected his collars, his\n",
      "vast cuffs, his brushed hair. His appearance was certainly that of a\n",
      "hairdresser's dummy; but in the great demoralization of the land he\n",
      "kept up his appearance. That's backbone. His starched collars and got-up\n",
      "shirt-fronts were achievements of character. He had been out nearly\n",
      "three years; and, later, I could not help asking him how he managed to\n",
      "sport such linen. He had just the faintest blush, and said modestly,\n",
      "'I've been teaching one of the native women about the station. It was\n",
      "difficult. She had a distaste for the work.' Thus this man had verily\n",
      "accomplished something. And he was devoted to his books, which were in\n",
      "apple-pie order.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Everything else in the station was in a muddle--heads, things,\n",
      "buildings. Strings of dusty niggers with splay feet arrived and\n",
      "departed; a stream of manufactured goods, rubbishy cottons, beads,\n",
      "and brass-wire sent into the depths of darkness, and in return came a\n",
      "precious trickle of ivory.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I had to wait in the station for ten days--an eternity. I lived in a\n",
      "hut in the yard, but to be out of the chaos I would sometimes get into\n",
      "the accountant's office. It was built of horizontal planks, and so badly\n",
      "put together that, as he bent over his high desk, he was barred from\n",
      "neck to heels with narrow strips of sunlight. There was no need to\n",
      "open the big shutter to see. It was hot there, too; big flies buzzed\n",
      "fiendishly, and did not sting, but stabbed. I sat generally on the\n",
      "floor, while, of faultless appearance (and even slightly scented),\n",
      "perching on a high stool, he wrote, he wrote. Sometimes he stood up for\n",
      "exercise. When a truckle-bed with a sick man (some invalid agent from\n",
      "upcountry) was put in there, he exhibited a gentle annoyance. 'The\n",
      "groans of this sick person,' he said, 'distract my attention. And\n",
      "without that it is extremely difficult to guard against clerical errors\n",
      "in this climate.'\n",

      "will no doubt meet Mr. Kurtz.' On my asking who Mr. Kurtz was, he\n",
      "said he was a first-class agent; and seeing my disappointment at\n",
      "this information, he added slowly, laying down his pen, 'He is a very\n",
      "remarkable person.' Further questions elicited from him that Mr. Kurtz\n",
      "was at present in charge of a trading-post, a very important one, in the\n",
      "true ivory-country, at 'the very bottom of there. Sends in as much ivory\n",
      "as all the others put together...' He began to write again. The sick\n",
      "man was too ill to groan. The flies buzzed in a great peace.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Suddenly there was a growing murmur of voices and a great tramping of\n",
      "feet. A caravan had come in. A violent babble of uncouth sounds burst\n",
      "out on the other side of the planks. All the carriers were speaking\n",
      "together, and in the midst of the uproar the lamentable voice of the\n",
      "chief agent was heard 'giving it up' tearfully for the twentieth time\n",
      "that day.... He rose slowly. 'What a frightful row,' he said. He\n",
      "crossed the room gently to look at the sick man, and returning, said to\n",
      "me, 'He does not hear.' 'What! Dead?' I asked, startled. 'No, not yet,'\n",
      "he answered, with great composure. Then, alluding with a toss of the\n",
      "head to the tumult in the station-yard, 'When one has got to make\n",
      "correct entries, one comes to hate those savages--hate them to the\n",
      "death.' He remained thoughtful for a moment. 'When you see Mr. Kurtz'\n",
      "he went on, 'tell him from me that everything here'--he glanced at the\n",
      "deck--' is very satisfactory. I don't like to write to him--with those\n",
      "messengers of ours you never know who may get hold of your letter--at\n",
      "that Central Station.' He stared at me for a moment with his mild,\n",
      "bulging eyes. 'Oh, he will go far, very far,' he began again. 'He\n",
      "will be a somebody in the Administration before long. They, above--the\n",
      "Council in Europe, you know--mean him to be.'\n",
      "\n",
      "“He turned to his work. The noise outside had ceased, and presently\n",
      "in going out I stopped at the door. In the steady buzz of flies the\n",
      "homeward-bound agent was lying finished and insensible; the other,\n",
      "bent over his books, was making correct entries of perfectly correct\n",
      "transactions; and fifty feet below the doorstep I could see the still\n",
      "tree-tops of the grove of death.\n",

      "“Next day I left that station at last, with a caravan of sixty men, for\n",

      "“No use telling you much about that. Paths, paths, everywhere; a\n",
      "stamped-in network of paths spreading over the empty land, through the\n",
      "long grass, through burnt grass, through thickets, down and up chilly\n",
      "ravines, up and down stony hills ablaze with heat; and a solitude, a\n",
      "solitude, nobody, not a hut. The population had cleared out a long\n",
      "time ago. Well, if a lot of mysterious niggers armed with all kinds of\n",
      "fearful weapons suddenly took to travelling on the road between Deal and\n",
      "Gravesend, catching the yokels right and left to carry heavy loads for\n",
      "them, I fancy every farm and cottage thereabouts would get empty very\n",
      "soon. Only here the dwellings were gone, too. Still I passed through\n",
      "several abandoned villages. There's something pathetically childish in\n",
      "the ruins of grass walls. Day after day, with the stamp and shuffle of\n",
      "sixty pair of bare feet behind me, each pair under a 60-lb. load. Camp,\n",
      "cook, sleep, strike camp, march. Now and then a carrier dead in harness,\n",
      "at rest in the long grass near the path, with an empty water-gourd and\n",
      "his long staff lying by his side. A great silence around and above.\n",
      "Perhaps on some quiet night the tremor of far-off drums, sinking,\n",
      "swelling, a tremor vast, faint; a sound weird, appealing, suggestive,\n",
      "and wild--and perhaps with as profound a meaning as the sound of bells\n",
      "in a Christian country. Once a white man in an unbuttoned uniform,\n",
      "camping on the path with an armed escort of lank Zanzibaris, very\n",
      "hospitable and festive--not to say drunk. Was looking after the upkeep\n",
      "of the road, he declared. Can't say I saw any road or any upkeep, unless\n",
      "the body of a middle-aged negro, with a bullet-hole in the forehead,\n",
      "upon which I absolutely stumbled three miles farther on, may be\n",
      "considered as a permanent improvement. I had a white companion, too,\n",
      "not a bad chap, but rather too fleshy and with the exasperating habit\n",
      "of fainting on the hot hillsides, miles away from the least bit of shade\n",
      "and water. Annoying, you know, to hold your own coat like a parasol over\n",
      "a man's head while he is coming to. I couldn't help asking him once what\n",
      "he meant by coming there at all. 'To make money, of course. What do you\n",
      "think?' he said, scornfully. Then he got fever, and had to be carried in\n",
      "a hammock slung under a pole. As he weighed sixteen stone I had no end\n",
      "of rows with the carriers. They jibbed, ran away, sneaked off with their\n",
      "loads in the night--quite a mutiny. So, one evening, I made a speech in\n",
      "English with gestures, not one of which was lost to the sixty pairs of\n",
      "eyes before me, and the next morning I started the hammock off in front\n",
      "all right. An hour afterwards I came upon the whole concern wrecked in\n",
      "a bush--man, hammock, groans, blankets, horrors. The heavy pole had\n",
      "skinned his poor nose. He was very anxious for me to kill somebody,\n",
      "but there wasn't the shadow of a carrier near. I remembered the old\n",
      "doctor--'It would be interesting for science to watch the mental changes\n",
      "of individuals, on the spot.' I felt I was becoming scientifically\n",
      "interesting. However, all that is to no purpose. On the fifteenth day\n",
      "I came in sight of the big river again, and hobbled into the Central\n",
      "Station. It was on a back water surrounded by scrub and forest, with\n",
      "a pretty border of smelly mud on one side, and on the three others\n",
      "enclosed by a crazy fence of rushes. A neglected gap was all the gate\n",
      "it had, and the first glance at the place was enough to let you see the\n",
      "flabby devil was running that show. White men with long staves in their\n",
      "hands appeared languidly from amongst the buildings, strolling up to\n",
      "take a look at me, and then retired out of sight somewhere. One of them,\n",
      "a stout, excitable chap with black moustaches, informed me with great\n",
      "volubility and many digressions, as soon as I told him who I was, that\n",
      "my steamer was at the bottom of the river. I was thunderstruck. What,\n",
      "how, why? Oh, it was 'all right.' The 'manager himself' was there. All\n",
      "quite correct. 'Everybody had behaved splendidly! splendidly!'--'you\n",
      "must,' he said in agitation, 'go and see the general manager at once. He\n",
      "is waiting!'\n",
      "\n",
      "“I did not see the real significance of that wreck at once. I fancy I\n",
      "see it now, but I am not sure--not at all. Certainly the affair was too\n",
      "stupid--when I think of it--to be altogether natural. Still... But\n",
      "at the moment it presented itself simply as a confounded nuisance. The\n",
      "steamer was sunk. They had started two days before in a sudden hurry\n",
      "up the river with the manager on board, in charge of some volunteer\n",
      "skipper, and before they had been out three hours they tore the bottom\n",
      "out of her on stones, and she sank near the south bank. I asked myself\n",
      "what I was to do there, now my boat was lost. As a matter of fact, I had\n",
      "plenty to do in fishing my command out of the river. I had to set about\n",
      "it the very next day. That, and the repairs when I brought the pieces to\n",
      "the station, took some months.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My first interview with the manager was curious. He did not ask me to\n",
      "sit down after my twenty-mile walk that morning. He was commonplace in\n",
      "complexion, in features, in manners, and in voice. He was of middle\n",
      "size and of ordinary build. His eyes, of the usual blue, were perhaps\n",
      "remarkably cold, and he certainly could make his glance fall on one as\n",
      "trenchant and heavy as an axe. But even at these times the rest of his\n",
      "person seemed to disclaim the intention. Otherwise there was\n",
      "only an indefinable, faint expression of his lips, something\n",
      "stealthy--a smile--not a smile--I remember it, but I can't explain. It\n",
      "was unconscious, this smile was, though just after he had said something\n",
      "it got intensified for an instant. It came at the end of his speeches\n",
      "like a seal applied on the words to make the meaning of the commonest\n",
      "phrase appear absolutely inscrutable. He was a common trader, from his\n",
      "youth up employed in these parts--nothing more. He was obeyed, yet he\n",
      "inspired neither love nor fear, nor even respect. He inspired\n",
      "uneasiness. That was it! Uneasiness. Not a definite mistrust--just\n",
      "uneasiness--nothing more. You have no idea how effective such a...\n",
      "a... faculty can be. He had no genius for organizing, for initiative,\n",
      "or for order even. That was evident in such things as the deplorable\n",
      "state of the station. He had no learning, and no intelligence. His\n",
      "position had come to him--why? Perhaps because he was never ill... He\n",
      "had served three terms of three years out there... Because triumphant\n",
      "health in the general rout of constitutions is a kind of power\n",
      "in itself. When he went home on leave he rioted on a large\n",
      "scale--pompously. Jack ashore--with a difference--in externals only.\n",
      "This one could gather from his casual talk. He originated nothing, he\n",
      "could keep the routine going--that's all. But he was great. He was great\n",
      "by this little thing that it was impossible to tell what could control\n",
      "such a man. He never gave that secret away. Perhaps there was nothing\n",
      "within him. Such a suspicion made one pause--for out there there were no\n",
      "external checks. Once when various tropical diseases had laid low almost\n",
      "every 'agent' in the station, he was heard to say, 'Men who come out\n",
      "here should have no entrails.' He sealed the utterance with that smile\n",
      "of his, as though it had been a door opening into a darkness he had in\n",
      "his keeping. You fancied you had seen things--but the seal was on. When\n",
      "annoyed at meal-times by the constant quarrels of the white men about\n",
      "precedence, he ordered an immense round table to be made, for which a\n",
      "special house had to be built. This was the station's mess-room. Where\n",
      "he sat was the first place--the rest were nowhere. One felt this to be\n",
      "his unalterable conviction. He was neither civil nor uncivil. He was\n",
      "quiet. He allowed his 'boy'--an overfed young negro from the coast--to\n",
      "treat the white men, under his very eyes, with provoking insolence.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He began to speak as soon as he saw me. I had been very long on the\n",
      "road. He could not wait. Had to start without me. The up-river stations\n",
      "had to be relieved. There had been so many delays already that he did\n",
      "not know who was dead and who was alive, and how they got on--and so on,\n",
      "and so on. He paid no attention to my explanations, and, playing with\n",
      "a stick of sealing-wax, repeated several times that the situation was\n",
      "'very grave, very grave.' There were rumours that a very important\n",
      "station was in jeopardy, and its chief, Mr. Kurtz, was ill. Hoped it was\n",
      "not true. Mr. Kurtz was... I felt weary and irritable. Hang Kurtz,\n",
      "I thought. I interrupted him by saying I had heard of Mr. Kurtz on the\n",
      "coast. 'Ah! So they talk of him down there,' he murmured to himself.\n",
      "Then he began again, assuring me Mr. Kurtz was the best agent he had, an\n",
      "exceptional man, of the greatest importance to the Company; therefore\n",
      "I could understand his anxiety. He was, he said, 'very, very uneasy.'\n",
      "Certainly he fidgeted on his chair a good deal, exclaimed, 'Ah, Mr.\n",
      "Kurtz!' broke the stick of sealing-wax and seemed dumfounded by the\n",
      "accident. Next thing he wanted to know 'how long it would take to'...\n",
      "I interrupted him again. Being hungry, you know, and kept on my feet\n",
      "too. I was getting savage. 'How can I tell?' I said. 'I haven't even\n",
      "seen the wreck yet--some months, no doubt.' All this talk seemed to me\n",
      "so futile. 'Some months,' he said. 'Well, let us say three months before\n",
      "we can make a start. Yes. That ought to do the affair.' I flung out\n",
      "of his hut (he lived all alone in a clay hut with a sort of verandah)\n",
      "muttering to myself my opinion of him. He was a chattering idiot.\n",
      "Afterwards I took it back when it was borne in upon me startlingly\n",
      "with what extreme nicety he had estimated the time requisite for the\n",
      "'affair.'\n",
      "\n",
      "“I went to work the next day, turning, so to speak, my back on that\n",
      "station. In that way only it seemed to me I could keep my hold on the\n",
      "redeeming facts of life. Still, one must look about sometimes; and then\n",
      "I saw this station, these men strolling aimlessly about in the sunshine\n",
      "of the yard. I asked myself sometimes what it all meant. They wandered\n",
      "here and there with their absurd long staves in their hands, like a lot\n",
      "of faithless pilgrims bewitched inside a rotten fence. The word 'ivory'\n",
      "rang in the air, was whispered, was sighed. You would think they were\n",
      "praying to it. A taint of imbecile rapacity blew through it all, like a\n",
      "whiff from some corpse. By Jove! I've never seen anything so unreal in\n",
      "my life. And outside, the silent wilderness surrounding this cleared\n",
      "speck on the earth struck me as something great and invincible, like\n",
      "evil or truth, waiting patiently for the passing away of this fantastic\n",
      "invasion.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, these months! Well, never mind. Various things happened. One\n",
      "evening a grass shed full of calico, cotton prints, beads, and I don't\n",
      "know what else, burst into a blaze so suddenly that you would have\n",
      "thought the earth had opened to let an avenging fire consume all that\n",
      "trash. I was smoking my pipe quietly by my dismantled steamer, and saw\n",
      "them all cutting capers in the light, with their arms lifted high, when\n",
      "the stout man with moustaches came tearing down to the river, a tin\n",
      "pail in his hand, assured me that everybody was 'behaving splendidly,\n",
      "splendidly,' dipped about a quart of water and tore back again. I\n",
      "noticed there was a hole in the bottom of his pail.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I strolled up. There was no hurry. You see the thing had gone off like\n",
      "a box of matches. It had been hopeless from the very first. The flame\n",
      "had leaped high, driven everybody back, lighted up everything--and\n",
      "collapsed. The shed was already a heap of embers glowing fiercely. A\n",
      "nigger was being beaten near by. They said he had caused the fire in\n",
      "some way; be that as it may, he was screeching most horribly. I saw him,\n",
      "later, for several days, sitting in a bit of shade looking very sick and\n",
      "trying to recover himself; afterwards he arose and went out--and\n",
      "the wilderness without a sound took him into its bosom again. As I\n",
      "approached the glow from the dark I found myself at the back of two men,\n",
      "talking. I heard the name of Kurtz pronounced, then the words, 'take\n",
      "advantage of this unfortunate accident.' One of the men was the manager.\n",
      "I wished him a good evening. 'Did you ever see anything like it--eh? it\n",
      "is incredible,' he said, and walked off. The other man remained. He was\n",
      "a first-class agent, young, gentlemanly, a bit reserved, with a forked\n",
      "little beard and a hooked nose. He was stand-offish with the other\n",
      "agents, and they on their side said he was the manager's spy upon them.\n",
      "As to me, I had hardly ever spoken to him before. We got into talk, and\n",
      "by and by we strolled away from the hissing ruins. Then he asked me to\n",
      "his room, which was in the main building of the station. He struck\n",
      "a match, and I perceived that this young aristocrat had not only a\n",

      "harmless as a little child, but I don't like to be dictated to. Am I the\n",
      "manager--or am I not? I was ordered to send him there. It's incredible.'\n",
      "... I became aware that the two were standing on the shore alongside\n",
      "the forepart of the steamboat, just below my head. I did not move; it\n",
      "did not occur to me to move: I was sleepy. 'It _is_ unpleasant,' grunted\n",
      "the uncle. 'He has asked the Administration to be sent there,' said the\n",
      "other, 'with the idea of showing what he could do; and I was instructed\n",
      "accordingly. Look at the influence that man must have. Is it not\n",
      "frightful?' They both agreed it was frightful, then made several bizarre\n",
      "remarks: 'Make rain and fine weather--one man--the Council--by the\n",
      "nose'--bits of absurd sentences that got the better of my drowsiness,\n",
      "so that I had pretty near the whole of my wits about me when the uncle\n",
      "said, 'The climate may do away with this difficulty for you. Is he alone\n",
      "there?' 'Yes,' answered the manager; 'he sent his assistant down the\n",
      "river with a note to me in these terms: “Clear this poor devil out of\n",
      "the country, and don't bother sending more of that sort. I had rather be\n",
      "alone than have the kind of men you can dispose of with me.” It was more\n",
      "than a year ago. Can you imagine such impudence!' 'Anything since then?'\n",
      "asked the other hoarsely. 'Ivory,' jerked the nephew; 'lots of it--prime\n",
      "sort--lots--most annoying, from him.' 'And with that?' questioned the\n",
      "heavy rumble. 'Invoice,' was the reply fired out, so to speak. Then\n",
      "silence. They had been talking about Kurtz.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I was broad awake by this time, but, lying perfectly at ease, remained\n",
      "still, having no inducement to change my position. 'How did that ivory\n",
      "come all this way?' growled the elder man, who seemed very vexed. The\n",
      "other explained that it had come with a fleet of canoes in charge of an\n",
      "English half-caste clerk Kurtz had with him; that Kurtz had apparently\n",
      "intended to return himself, the station being by that time bare of goods\n",
      "and stores, but after coming three hundred miles, had suddenly decided\n",
      "to go back, which he started to do alone in a small dugout with four\n",
      "paddlers, leaving the half-caste to continue down the river with the\n",
      "ivory. The two fellows there seemed astounded at anybody attempting such\n",
      "a thing. They were at a loss for an adequate motive. As to me, I seemed\n",
      "to see Kurtz for the first time. It was a distinct glimpse: the dugout,\n",
      "four paddling savages, and the lone white man turning his back suddenly\n",
      "on the headquarters, on relief, on thoughts of home--perhaps; setting\n",
      "his face towards the depths of the wilderness, towards his empty and\n",
      "desolate station. I did not know the motive. Perhaps he was just simply\n",
      "a fine fellow who stuck to his work for its own sake. His name, you\n",
      "understand, had not been pronounced once. He was 'that man.' The\n",
      "half-caste, who, as far as I could see, had conducted a difficult\n",
      "trip with great prudence and pluck, was invariably alluded to as 'that\n",
      "scoundrel.' The 'scoundrel' had reported that the 'man' had been very\n",
      "ill--had recovered imperfectly.... The two below me moved away then a\n",
      "few paces, and strolled back and forth at some little distance. I heard:\n",
      "'Military post--doctor--two hundred miles--quite alone now--unavoidable\n",
      "delays--nine months--no news--strange rumours.' They approached again,\n",
      "just as the manager was saying, 'No one, as far as I know, unless a\n",
      "species of wandering trader--a pestilential fellow, snapping ivory\n",
      "from the natives.' Who was it they were talking about now? I gathered in\n",
      "snatches that this was some man supposed to be in Kurtz's district, and\n",
      "of whom the manager did not approve. 'We will not be free from unfair\n",
      "competition till one of these fellows is hanged for an example,'\n",
      "he said. 'Certainly,' grunted the other; 'get him hanged! Why not?\n",
      "Anything--anything can be done in this country. That's what I say;\n",
      "nobody here, you understand, _here_, can endanger your position. And why?\n",
      "You stand the climate--you outlast them all. The danger is in Europe;\n",
      "but there before I left I took care to--' They moved off and whispered,\n",
      "then their voices rose again. 'The extraordinary series of delays is\n",
      "not my fault. I did my best.' The fat man sighed. 'Very sad.' 'And the\n",
      "pestiferous absurdity of his talk,' continued the other; 'he bothered\n",
      "me enough when he was here. “Each station should be like a beacon on the\n",
      "road towards better things, a centre for trade of course, but also for\n",
      "humanizing, improving, instructing.” Conceive you--that ass! And\n",
      "he wants to be manager! No, it's--' Here he got choked by excessive\n",
      "indignation, and I lifted my head the least bit. I was surprised to see\n",
      "how near they were--right under me. I could have spat upon their hats.\n",
      "They were looking on the ground, absorbed in thought. The manager was\n",
      "switching his leg with a slender twig: his sagacious relative lifted his\n",
      "head. 'You have been well since you came out this time?' he asked. The\n",
      "other gave a start. 'Who? I? Oh! Like a charm--like a charm. But the\n",

      "the time to send them out of the country--it's incredible!' 'Hm'm.\n",
      "Just so,' grunted the uncle. 'Ah! my boy, trust to this--I say, trust to\n",
      "this.' I saw him extend his short flipper of an arm for a gesture that\n",
      "took in the forest, the creek, the mud, the river--seemed to beckon\n",
      "with a dishonouring flourish before the sunlit face of the land a\n",
      "treacherous appeal to the lurking death, to the hidden evil, to the\n",
      "profound darkness of its heart. It was so startling that I leaped to my\n",
      "feet and looked back at the edge of the forest, as though I had expected\n",
      "an answer of some sort to that black display of confidence. You know\n",
      "the foolish notions that come to one sometimes. The high stillness\n",
      "confronted these two figures with its ominous patience, waiting for the\n",

      "“They swore aloud together--out of sheer fright, I believe--then\n",

      "of the less valuable animals. They, no doubt, like the rest of us, found\n",
      "what they deserved. I did not inquire. I was then rather excited at\n",
      "the prospect of meeting Kurtz very soon. When I say very soon I mean\n",

      "of the world, when vegetation rioted on the earth and the big trees were\n",
      "kings. An empty stream, a great silence, an impenetrable forest. The air\n",
      "was warm, thick, heavy, sluggish. There was no joy in the brilliance of\n",
      "sunshine. The long stretches of the waterway ran on, deserted, into\n",
      "the gloom of overshadowed distances. On silvery sand-banks hippos and\n",
      "alligators sunned themselves side by side. The broadening waters flowed\n",
      "through a mob of wooded islands; you lost your way on that river as you\n",
      "would in a desert, and butted all day long against shoals, trying to\n",
      "find the channel, till you thought yourself bewitched and cut off for\n",
      "ever from everything you had known once--somewhere--far away--in another\n",
      "existence perhaps. There were moments when one's past came back to one,\n",
      "as it will sometimes when you have not a moment to spare for yourself;\n",
      "but it came in the shape of an unrestful and noisy dream, remembered\n",
      "with wonder amongst the overwhelming realities of this strange world of\n",
      "plants, and water, and silence. And this stillness of life did not in\n",
      "the least resemble a peace. It was the stillness of an implacable force\n",
      "brooding over an inscrutable intention. It looked at you with a vengeful\n",
      "aspect. I got used to it afterwards; I did not see it any more; I had no\n",
      "time. I had to keep guessing at the channel; I had to discern, mostly by\n",
      "inspiration, the signs of hidden banks; I watched for sunken stones; I\n",
      "was learning to clap my teeth smartly before my heart flew out, when I\n",
      "shaved by a fluke some infernal sly old snag that would have ripped the\n",
      "life out of the tin-pot steamboat and drowned all the pilgrims; I had to\n",

      "nostrils. Phoo! I can sniff it now. I had the manager on board and three\n",
      "or four pilgrims with their staves--all complete. Sometimes we came\n",

      "appearance of being held there captive by a spell. The word ivory would\n",
      "ring in the air for a while--and on we went again into the silence,\n",
      "along empty reaches, round the still bends, between the high walls of\n",
      "our winding way, reverberating in hollow claps the ponderous beat of the\n",
      "stern-wheel. Trees, trees, millions of trees, massive, immense, running\n",
      "up high; and at their foot, hugging the bank against the stream, crept\n",
      "the little begrimed steamboat, like a sluggish beetle crawling on the\n",
      "floor of a lofty portico. It made you feel very small, very lost, and\n",
      "yet it was not altogether depressing, that feeling. After all, if you\n",
      "were small, the grimy beetle crawled on--which was just what you wanted\n",

      "leaking we crawled very slow. The reaches opened before us and closed\n",
      "behind, as if the forest had stepped leisurely across the water to bar\n",
      "the way for our return. We penetrated deeper and deeper into the heart\n",
      "of darkness. It was very quiet there. At night sometimes the roll of\n",
      "drums behind the curtain of trees would run up the river and remain\n",
      "sustained faintly, as if hovering in the air high over our heads, till\n",
      "the first break of day. Whether it meant war, peace, or prayer we could\n",
      "not tell. The dawns were heralded by the descent of a chill stillness;\n",
      "the wood-cutters slept, their fires burned low; the snapping of a twig\n",
      "would make you start. We were wanderers on a prehistoric earth, on an\n",
      "earth that wore the aspect of an unknown planet. We could have fancied\n",
      "ourselves the first of men taking possession of an accursed inheritance,\n",
      "to be subdued at the cost of profound anguish and of excessive toil. But\n",
      "suddenly, as we struggled round a bend, there would be a glimpse of rush\n",
      "walls, of peaked grass-roofs, a burst of yells, a whirl of black limbs,\n",
      "a mass of hands clapping of feet stamping, of bodies swaying, of eyes\n",
      "rolling, under the droop of heavy and motionless foliage. The steamer\n",
      "toiled along slowly on the edge of a black and incomprehensible frenzy.\n",
      "The prehistoric man was cursing us, praying to us, welcoming us--who\n",
      "could tell? We were cut off from the comprehension of our surroundings;\n",
      "we glided past like phantoms, wondering and secretly appalled, as sane\n",
      "men would be before an enthusiastic outbreak in a madhouse. We could\n",
      "not understand because we were too far and could not remember because we\n",

      "not inhuman. Well, you know, that was the worst of it--this suspicion\n",
      "of their not being inhuman. It would come slowly to one. They howled and\n",
      "leaped, and spun, and made horrid faces; but what thrilled you was just\n",
      "the thought of their humanity--like yours--the thought of your remote\n",
      "kinship with this wild and passionate uproar. Ugly. Yes, it was ugly\n",
      "enough; but if you were man enough you would admit to yourself that\n",
      "there was in you just the faintest trace of a response to the terrible\n",
      "frankness of that noise, a dim suspicion of there being a meaning in it\n",

      "all? Joy, fear, sorrow, devotion, valour, rage--who can tell?--but\n",
      "truth--truth stripped of its cloak of time. Let the fool gape and\n",
      "shudder--the man knows, and can look on without a wink. But he must at\n",
      "least be as much of a man as these on the shore. He must meet that truth\n",
      "with his own true stuff--with his own inborn strength. Principles won't\n",
      "do. Acquisitions, clothes, pretty rags--rags that would fly off at the\n",
      "first good shake. No; you want a deliberate belief. An appeal to me in\n",
      "this fiendish row--is there? Very well; I hear; I admit, but I have\n",
      "a voice, too, and for good or evil mine is the speech that cannot be\n",
      "silenced. Of course, a fool, what with sheer fright and fine sentiments,\n",
      "is always safe. Who's that grunting? You wonder I didn't go ashore for\n",
      "a howl and a dance? Well, no--I didn't. Fine sentiments, you say?\n",
      "Fine sentiments, be hanged! I had no time. I had to mess about with\n",
      "white-lead and strips of woolen blanket helping to put bandages on\n",
      "those leaky steam-pipes--I tell you. I had to watch the steering, and\n",
      "circumvent those snags, and get the tin-pot along by hook or by crook.\n",
      "There was surface-truth enough in these things to save a wiser man. And\n",
      "between whiles I had to look after the savage who was fireman. He was\n",
      "an improved specimen; he could fire up a vertical boiler. He was there\n",
      "below me, and, upon my word, to look at him was as edifying as seeing a\n",
      "dog in a parody of breeches and a feather hat, walking on his hind-legs.\n",
      "A few months of training had done for that really fine chap. He squinted\n",
      "at the steam-gauge and at the water-gauge with an evident effort of\n",
      "intrepidity--and he had filed teeth, too, the poor devil, and the wool\n",
      "of his pate shaved into queer patterns, and three ornamental scars\n",
      "on each of his cheeks. He ought to have been clapping his hands and\n",
      "stamping his feet on the bank, instead of which he was hard at work, a\n",
      "thrall to strange witchcraft, full of improving knowledge. He was useful\n",
      "because he had been instructed; and what he knew was this--that should\n",
      "the water in that transparent thing disappear, the evil spirit inside\n",
      "the boiler would get angry through the greatness of his thirst, and take\n",
      "a terrible vengeance. So he sweated and fired up and watched the glass\n",
      "fearfully (with an impromptu charm, made of rags, tied to his arm, and\n",
      "a piece of polished bone, as big as a watch, stuck flatways through his\n",
      "lower lip), while the wooded banks slipped past us slowly, the short\n",
      "noise was left behind, the interminable miles of silence--and we crept\n",
      "on, towards Kurtz. But the snags were thick, the water was treacherous\n",

      "“Some fifty miles below the Inner Station we came upon a hut of reeds,\n",
      "an inclined and melancholy pole, with the unrecognizable tatters of\n",
      "what had been a flag of some sort flying from it, and a neatly stacked\n",
      "wood-pile. This was unexpected. We came to the bank, and on the stack of\n",
      "firewood found a flat piece of board with some faded pencil-writing\n",
      "on it. When deciphered it said: 'Wood for you. Hurry up. Approach\n",
      "cautiously.' There was a signature, but it was illegible--not\n",
      "Kurtz--a much longer word. 'Hurry up.' Where? Up the river? 'Approach\n",
      "cautiously.' We had not done so. But the warning could not have been\n",
      "meant for the place where it could be only found after approach.\n",
      "Something was wrong above. But what--and how much? That was the\n",
      "question. We commented adversely upon the imbecility of that telegraphic\n",
      "style. The bush around said nothing, and would not let us look very far,\n",
      "either. A torn curtain of red twill hung in the doorway of the hut, and\n",
      "flapped sadly in our faces. The dwelling was dismantled; but we could\n",

      "table--a plank on two posts; a heap of rubbish reposed in a dark corner,\n",
      "and by the door I picked up a book. It had lost its covers, and the\n",
      "pages had been thumbed into a state of extremely dirty softness; but the\n",
      "back had been lovingly stitched afresh with white cotton thread, which\n",
      "looked clean yet. It was an extraordinary find. Its title was, _An\n",
      "Inquiry into some Points of Seamanship_, by a man Towser, Towson--some\n",
      "such name--Master in his Majesty's Navy. The matter looked dreary\n",
      "reading enough, with illustrative diagrams and repulsive tables of\n",
      "figures, and the copy was sixty years old. I handled this amazing\n",
      "antiquity with the greatest possible tenderness, lest it should dissolve\n",
      "in my hands. Within, Towson or Towser was inquiring earnestly into the\n",
      "breaking strain of ships' chains and tackle, and other such matters. Not\n",
      "a very enthralling book; but at the first glance you could see there a\n",
      "singleness of intention, an honest concern for the right way of going\n",
      "to work, which made these humble pages, thought out so many years ago,\n",
      "luminous with another than a professional light. The simple old sailor,\n",
      "with his talk of chains and purchases, made me forget the jungle and\n",

      "unmistakably real. Such a book being there was wonderful enough; but\n",

      "tree a little way ahead to measure our progress towards Kurtz by, but\n",
      "I lost it invariably before we got abreast. To keep the eyes so long\n",
      "on one thing was too much for human patience. The manager displayed\n",
      "a beautiful resignation. I fretted and fumed and took to arguing with\n",
      "myself whether or no I would talk openly with Kurtz; but before I could\n",
      "come to any conclusion it occurred to me that my speech or my silence,\n",
      "indeed any action of mine, would be a mere futility. What did it matter\n",
      "what any one knew or ignored? What did it matter who was manager? One\n",
      "gets sometimes such a flash of insight. The essentials of this affair\n",
      "lay deep under the surface, beyond my reach, and beyond my power of\n",
      "meddling.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Towards the evening of the second day we judged ourselves about eight\n",
      "miles from Kurtz's station. I wanted to push on; but the manager looked\n",
      "grave, and told me the navigation up there was so dangerous that it\n",
      "would be advisable, the sun being very low already, to wait where we\n",
      "were till next morning. Moreover, he pointed out that if the warning\n",
      "to approach cautiously were to be followed, we must approach in\n",
      "daylight--not at dusk or in the dark. This was sensible enough. Eight\n",
      "miles meant nearly three hours' steaming for us, and I could also see\n",
      "suspicious ripples at the upper end of the reach. Nevertheless, I was\n",
      "annoyed beyond expression at the delay, and most unreasonably, too,\n",
      "since one night more could not matter much after so many months. As we\n",
      "had plenty of wood, and caution was the word, I brought up in the middle\n",
      "of the stream. The reach was narrow, straight, with high sides like a\n",
      "railway cutting. The dusk came gliding into it long before the sun had\n",
      "set. The current ran smooth and swift, but a dumb immobility sat on the\n",
      "banks. The living trees, lashed together by the creepers and every\n",
      "living bush of the undergrowth, might have been changed into stone, even\n",
      "to the slenderest twig, to the lightest leaf. It was not sleep--it\n",
      "seemed unnatural, like a state of trance. Not the faintest sound of any\n",
      "kind could be heard. You looked on amazed, and began to suspect yourself\n",
      "of being deaf--then the night came suddenly, and struck you blind as\n",
      "well. About three in the morning some large fish leaped, and the loud\n",
      "splash made me jump as though a gun had been fired. When the sun rose\n",
      "there was a white fog, very warm and clammy, and more blinding than the\n",
      "night. It did not shift or drive; it was just there, standing all round\n",
      "you like something solid. At eight or nine, perhaps, it lifted as a\n",
      "shutter lifts. We had a glimpse of the towering multitude of trees, of\n",
      "the immense matted jungle, with the blazing little ball of the sun\n",
      "hanging over it--all perfectly still--and then the white shutter came\n",
      "down again, smoothly, as if sliding in greased grooves. I ordered the\n",
      "chain, which we had begun to heave in, to be paid out again. Before it\n",
      "stopped running with a muffled rattle, a cry, a very loud cry, as of\n",
      "infinite desolation, soared slowly in the opaque air. It ceased. A\n",
      "complaining clamour, modulated in savage discords, filled our ears. The\n",
      "sheer unexpectedness of it made my hair stir under my cap. I don't know\n",
      "how it struck the others: to me it seemed as though the mist itself had\n",
      "screamed, so suddenly, and apparently from all sides at once, did this\n",
      "tumultuous and mournful uproar arise. It culminated in a hurried\n",
      "outbreak of almost intolerably excessive shrieking, which stopped short,\n",
      "leaving us stiffened in a variety of silly attitudes, and obstinately\n",
      "listening to the nearly as appalling and excessive silence. 'Good God!\n",
      "What is the meaning--' stammered at my elbow one of the pilgrims--a\n",
      "little fat man, with sandy hair and red whiskers, who wore sidespring\n",
      "boots, and pink pyjamas tucked into his socks. Two others remained\n",
      "open-mouthed a while minute, then dashed into the little cabin, to rush\n",
      "out incontinently and stand darting scared glances, with Winchesters at\n",
      "'ready' in their hands. What we could see was just the steamer we were\n",
      "on, her outlines blurred as though she had been on the point of\n",
      "dissolving, and a misty strip of water, perhaps two feet broad, around\n",
      "her--and that was all. The rest of the world was nowhere, as far as our\n",
      "eyes and ears were concerned. Just nowhere. Gone, disappeared; swept off\n",
      "without leaving a whisper or a shadow behind.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I went forward, and ordered the chain to be hauled in short, so as to\n",
      "be ready to trip the anchor and move the steamboat at once if necessary.\n",
      "'Will they attack?' whispered an awed voice. 'We will be all butchered\n",
      "in this fog,' murmured another. The faces twitched with the strain, the\n",
      "hands trembled slightly, the eyes forgot to wink. It was very curious\n",
      "to see the contrast of expressions of the white men and of the black\n",
      "fellows of our crew, who were as much strangers to that part of the\n",
      "river as we, though their homes were only eight hundred miles away. The\n",
      "whites, of course greatly discomposed, had besides a curious look of\n",
      "being painfully shocked by such an outrageous row. The others had an\n",
      "alert, naturally interested expression; but their faces were essentially\n",
      "quiet, even those of the one or two who grinned as they hauled at the\n",
      "chain. Several exchanged short, grunting phrases, which seemed to settle\n",
      "the matter to their satisfaction. Their headman, a young, broad-chested\n",
      "black, severely draped in dark-blue fringed cloths, with fierce nostrils\n",
      "and his hair all done up artfully in oily ringlets, stood near me.\n",
      "'Aha!' I said, just for good fellowship's sake. 'Catch 'im,' he snapped,\n",
      "with a bloodshot widening of his eyes and a flash of sharp teeth--'catch\n",
      "'im. Give 'im to us.' 'To you, eh?' I asked; 'what would you do with\n",
      "them?' 'Eat 'im!' he said curtly, and, leaning his elbow on the rail,\n",
      "looked out into the fog in a dignified and profoundly pensive attitude.\n",
      "I would no doubt have been properly horrified, had it not occurred to\n",
      "me that he and his chaps must be very hungry: that they must have been\n",
      "growing increasingly hungry for at least this month past. They had been\n",
      "engaged for six months (I don't think a single one of them had any\n",
      "clear idea of time, as we at the end of countless ages have. They still\n",
      "belonged to the beginnings of time--had no inherited experience to teach\n",
      "them as it were), and of course, as long as there was a piece of paper\n",
      "written over in accordance with some farcical law or other made down the\n",
      "river, it didn't enter anybody's head to trouble how they would live.\n",
      "Certainly they had brought with them some rotten hippo-meat, which\n",
      "couldn't have lasted very long, anyway, even if the pilgrims hadn't, in\n",
      "the midst of a shocking hullabaloo, thrown a considerable quantity of it\n",
      "overboard. It looked like a high-handed proceeding; but it was really\n",
      "a case of legitimate self-defence. You can't breathe dead hippo waking,\n",
      "sleeping, and eating, and at the same time keep your precarious grip on\n",
      "existence. Besides that, they had given them every week three pieces of\n",
      "brass wire, each about nine inches long; and the theory was they were to\n",
      "buy their provisions with that currency in riverside villages. You can\n",
      "see how _that_ worked. There were either no villages, or the people were\n",
      "hostile, or the director, who like the rest of us fed out of tins, with\n",
      "an occasional old he-goat thrown in, didn't want to stop the steamer for\n",
      "some more or less recondite reason. So, unless they swallowed the wire\n",
      "itself, or made loops of it to snare the fishes with, I don't see what\n",
      "good their extravagant salary could be to them. I must say it was paid\n",
      "with a regularity worthy of a large and honourable trading company. For\n",
      "the rest, the only thing to eat--though it didn't look eatable in the\n",
      "least--I saw in their possession was a few lumps of some stuff like\n",
      "half-cooked dough, of a dirty lavender colour, they kept wrapped in\n",
      "leaves, and now and then swallowed a piece of, but so small that it\n",
      "seemed done more for the looks of the thing than for any serious purpose\n",
      "of sustenance. Why in the name of all the gnawing devils of hunger they\n",
      "didn't go for us--they were thirty to five--and have a good tuck-in for\n",
      "once, amazes me now when I think of it. They were big powerful men,\n",
      "with not much capacity to weigh the consequences, with courage, with\n",
      "strength, even yet, though their skins were no longer glossy and their\n",
      "muscles no longer hard. And I saw that something restraining, one of\n",
      "those human secrets that baffle probability, had come into play there.\n",
      "I looked at them with a swift quickening of interest--not because it\n",
      "occurred to me I might be eaten by them before very long, though I own\n",
      "to you that just then I perceived--in a new light, as it were--how\n",
      "unwholesome the pilgrims looked, and I hoped, yes, I positively hoped,\n",
      "that my aspect was not so--what shall I say?--so--unappetizing: a touch\n",
      "of fantastic vanity which fitted well with the dream-sensation that\n",
      "pervaded all my days at that time. Perhaps I had a little fever, too.\n",
      "One can't live with one's finger everlastingly on one's pulse. I had\n",
      "often 'a little fever,' or a little touch of other things--the playful\n",
      "paw-strokes of the wilderness, the preliminary trifling before the more\n",
      "serious onslaught which came in due course. Yes; I looked at them as you\n",
      "would on any human being, with a curiosity of their impulses, motives,\n",
      "capacities, weaknesses, when brought to the test of an inexorable\n",
      "physical necessity. Restraint! What possible restraint? Was it\n",
      "superstition, disgust, patience, fear--or some kind of primitive honour?\n",
      "No fear can stand up to hunger, no patience can wear it out, disgust\n",
      "simply does not exist where hunger is; and as to superstition, beliefs,\n",
      "and what you may call principles, they are less than chaff in a breeze.\n",
      "Don't you know the devilry of lingering starvation, its exasperating\n",
      "torment, its black thoughts, its sombre and brooding ferocity? Well,\n",
      "I do. It takes a man all his inborn strength to fight hunger properly.\n",
      "It's really easier to face bereavement, dishonour, and the perdition of\n",
      "one's soul--than this kind of prolonged hunger. Sad, but true. And these\n",
      "chaps, too, had no earthly reason for any kind of scruple. Restraint! I\n",
      "would just as soon have expected restraint from a hyena prowling amongst\n",
      "the corpses of a battlefield. But there was the fact facing me--the fact\n",
      "dazzling, to be seen, like the foam on the depths of the sea, like a\n",
      "ripple on an unfathomable enigma, a mystery greater--when I thought\n",
      "of it--than the curious, inexplicable note of desperate grief in this\n",
      "savage clamour that had swept by us on the river-bank, behind the blind\n",
      "whiteness of the fog.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Two pilgrims were quarrelling in hurried whispers as to which bank.\n",
      "'Left.' 'no, no; how can you? Right, right, of course.' 'It is very\n",
      "serious,' said the manager's voice behind me; 'I would be desolated if\n",
      "anything should happen to Mr. Kurtz before we came up.' I looked at him,\n",
      "and had not the slightest doubt he was sincere. He was just the kind of\n",
      "man who would wish to preserve appearances. That was his restraint. But\n",
      "when he muttered something about going on at once, I did not even take\n",
      "the trouble to answer him. I knew, and he knew, that it was impossible.\n",
      "Were we to let go our hold of the bottom, we would be absolutely in\n",
      "the air--in space. We wouldn't be able to tell where we were going\n",
      "to--whether up or down stream, or across--till we fetched against one\n",
      "bank or the other--and then we wouldn't know at first which it was.\n",
      "Of course I made no move. I had no mind for a smash-up. You couldn't\n",
      "imagine a more deadly place for a shipwreck. Whether we drowned at\n",
      "once or not, we were sure to perish speedily in one way or another. 'I\n",
      "authorize you to take all the risks,' he said, after a short silence.\n",
      "'I refuse to take any,' I said shortly; which was just the answer he\n",
      "expected, though its tone might have surprised him. 'Well, I must defer\n",
      "to your judgment. You are captain,' he said with marked civility. I\n",
      "turned my shoulder to him in sign of my appreciation, and looked into\n",
      "the fog. How long would it last? It was the most hopeless lookout. The\n",
      "approach to this Kurtz grubbing for ivory in the wretched bush was beset\n",
      "by as many dangers as though he had been an enchanted princess sleeping\n",
      "in a fabulous castle. 'Will they attack, do you think?' asked the\n",
      "manager, in a confidential tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I did not think they would attack, for several obvious reasons. The\n",
      "thick fog was one. If they left the bank in their canoes they would get\n",
      "lost in it, as we would be if we attempted to move. Still, I had also\n",
      "judged the jungle of both banks quite impenetrable--and yet eyes were\n",
      "in it, eyes that had seen us. The riverside bushes were certainly very\n",
      "thick; but the undergrowth behind was evidently penetrable.\n",
      "However, during the short lift I had seen no canoes anywhere in the\n",
      "reach--certainly not abreast of the steamer. But what made the idea of\n",
      "attack inconceivable to me was the nature of the noise--of the cries we\n",
      "had heard. They had not the fierce character boding immediate hostile\n",
      "intention. Unexpected, wild, and violent as they had been, they had\n",
      "given me an irresistible impression of sorrow. The glimpse of the\n",
      "steamboat had for some reason filled those savages with unrestrained\n",
      "grief. The danger, if any, I expounded, was from our proximity to a\n",
      "great human passion let loose. Even extreme grief may ultimately vent\n",
      "itself in violence--but more generally takes the form of apathy....\n",
      "\n",
      "“You should have seen the pilgrims stare! They had no heart to grin, or\n",
      "even to revile me: but I believe they thought me gone mad--with fright,\n",
      "maybe. I delivered a regular lecture. My dear boys, it was no good\n",
      "bothering. Keep a lookout? Well, you may guess I watched the fog for\n",
      "the signs of lifting as a cat watches a mouse; but for anything else our\n",
      "eyes were of no more use to us than if we had been buried miles deep in\n",
      "a heap of cotton-wool. It felt like it, too--choking, warm, stifling.\n",
      "Besides, all I said, though it sounded extravagant, was absolutely\n",
      "true to fact. What we afterwards alluded to as an attack was really an\n",
      "attempt at repulse. The action was very far from being aggressive--it\n",
      "was not even defensive, in the usual sense: it was undertaken under the\n",
      "stress of desperation, and in its essence was purely protective.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It developed itself, I should say, two hours after the fog lifted, and\n",
      "its commencement was at a spot, roughly speaking, about a mile and a\n",
      "half below Kurtz's station. We had just floundered and flopped round a\n",
      "bend, when I saw an islet, a mere grassy hummock of bright green, in the\n",
      "middle of the stream. It was the only thing of the kind; but as we opened\n",
      "the reach more, I perceived it was the head of a long sand-bank, or\n",
      "rather of a chain of shallow patches stretching down the middle of the\n",
      "river. They were discoloured, just awash, and the whole lot was seen\n",
      "just under the water, exactly as a man's backbone is seen running down\n",
      "the middle of his back under the skin. Now, as far as I did see, I could\n",
      "go to the right or to the left of this. I didn't know either channel, of\n",
      "course. The banks looked pretty well alike, the depth appeared the same;\n",
      "but as I had been informed the station was on the west side, I naturally\n",
      "headed for the western passage.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No sooner had we fairly entered it than I became aware it was much\n",
      "narrower than I had supposed. To the left of us there was the long\n",
      "uninterrupted shoal, and to the right a high, steep bank heavily\n",
      "overgrown with bushes. Above the bush the trees stood in serried ranks.\n",
      "The twigs overhung the current thickly, and from distance to distance a\n",
      "large limb of some tree projected rigidly over the stream. It was then\n",
      "well on in the afternoon, the face of the forest was gloomy, and a\n",
      "broad strip of shadow had already fallen on the water. In this shadow\n",
      "we steamed up--very slowly, as you may imagine. I sheered her well\n",
      "inshore--the water being deepest near the bank, as the sounding-pole\n",
      "informed me.\n",
      "\n",
      "“One of my hungry and forbearing friends was sounding in the bows just\n",
      "below me. This steamboat was exactly like a decked scow. On the deck,\n",
      "there were two little teakwood houses, with doors and windows. The\n",
      "boiler was in the fore-end, and the machinery right astern. Over\n",
      "the whole there was a light roof, supported on stanchions. The funnel\n",
      "projected through that roof, and in front of the funnel a small cabin\n",
      "built of light planks served for a pilot-house. It contained a couch,\n",
      "two camp-stools, a loaded Martini-Henry leaning in one corner, a tiny\n",
      "table, and the steering-wheel. It had a wide door in front and a broad\n",
      "shutter at each side. All these were always thrown open, of course. I\n",
      "spent my days perched up there on the extreme fore-end of that roof,\n",
      "before the door. At night I slept, or tried to, on the couch. An\n",
      "athletic black belonging to some coast tribe and educated by my poor\n",
      "predecessor, was the helmsman. He sported a pair of brass earrings, wore\n",
      "a blue cloth wrapper from the waist to the ankles, and thought all the\n",
      "world of himself. He was the most unstable kind of fool I had ever seen.\n",
      "He steered with no end of a swagger while you were by; but if he lost\n",
      "sight of you, he became instantly the prey of an abject funk, and would\n",
      "let that cripple of a steamboat get the upper hand of him in a minute.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I was looking down at the sounding-pole, and feeling much annoyed to\n",
      "see at each try a little more of it stick out of that river, when I saw\n",
      "my poleman give up on the business suddenly, and stretch himself flat on\n",
      "the deck, without even taking the trouble to haul his pole in. He kept\n",
      "hold on it though, and it trailed in the water. At the same time the\n",
      "fireman, whom I could also see below me, sat down abruptly before his\n",
      "furnace and ducked his head. I was amazed. Then I had to look at the\n",
      "river mighty quick, because there was a snag in the fairway. Sticks,\n",
      "little sticks, were flying about--thick: they were whizzing before my\n",
      "nose, dropping below me, striking behind me against my pilot-house. All\n",
      "this time the river, the shore, the woods, were very quiet--perfectly\n",
      "quiet. I could only hear the heavy splashing thump of the stern-wheel\n",
      "and the patter of these things. We cleared the snag clumsily. Arrows, by\n",
      "Jove! We were being shot at! I stepped in quickly to close the shutter\n",
      "on the landside. That fool-helmsman, his hands on the spokes, was\n",
      "lifting his knees high, stamping his feet, champing his mouth, like a\n",
      "reined-in horse. Confound him! And we were staggering within ten feet of\n",
      "the bank. I had to lean right out to swing the heavy shutter, and I saw\n",
      "a face amongst the leaves on the level with my own, looking at me very\n",
      "fierce and steady; and then suddenly, as though a veil had been removed\n",
      "from my eyes, I made out, deep in the tangled gloom, naked breasts,\n",
      "arms, legs, glaring eyes--the bush was swarming with human limbs in\n",
      "movement, glistening of bronze colour. The twigs shook, swayed, and\n",
      "rustled, the arrows flew out of them, and then the shutter came to.\n",
      "'Steer her straight,' I said to the helmsman. He held his head rigid,\n",
      "face forward; but his eyes rolled, he kept on lifting and setting down\n",
      "his feet gently, his mouth foamed a little. 'Keep quiet!' I said in a\n",
      "fury. I might just as well have ordered a tree not to sway in the wind.\n",
      "I darted out. Below me there was a great scuffle of feet on the iron\n",
      "deck; confused exclamations; a voice screamed, 'Can you turn back?'\n",
      "I caught sight of a V-shaped ripple on the water ahead. What? Another\n",
      "snag! A fusillade burst out under my feet. The pilgrims had opened with\n",
      "their Winchesters, and were simply squirting lead into that bush. A\n",
      "deuce of a lot of smoke came up and drove slowly forward. I swore at\n",
      "it. Now I couldn't see the ripple or the snag either. I stood in the\n",
      "doorway, peering, and the arrows came in swarms. They might have been\n",
      "poisoned, but they looked as though they wouldn't kill a cat. The bush\n",
      "began to howl. Our wood-cutters raised a warlike whoop; the report of a\n",
      "rifle just at my back deafened me. I glanced over my shoulder, and the\n",
      "pilot-house was yet full of noise and smoke when I made a dash at the\n",
      "wheel. The fool-nigger had dropped everything, to throw the shutter\n",
      "open and let off that Martini-Henry. He stood before the wide opening,\n",
      "glaring, and I yelled at him to come back, while I straightened the\n",
      "sudden twist out of that steamboat. There was no room to turn even if I\n",
      "had wanted to, the snag was somewhere very near ahead in that confounded\n",
      "smoke, there was no time to lose, so I just crowded her into the\n",
      "bank--right into the bank, where I knew the water was deep.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We tore slowly along the overhanging bushes in a whirl of broken twigs\n",
      "and flying leaves. The fusillade below stopped short, as I had foreseen\n",
      "it would when the squirts got empty. I threw my head back to a glinting\n",
      "whizz that traversed the pilot-house, in at one shutter-hole and out\n",
      "at the other. Looking past that mad helmsman, who was shaking the empty\n",
      "rifle and yelling at the shore, I saw vague forms of men running bent\n",
      "double, leaping, gliding, distinct, incomplete, evanescent. Something\n",
      "big appeared in the air before the shutter, the rifle went overboard,\n",
      "and the man stepped back swiftly, looked at me over his shoulder in an\n",
      "extraordinary, profound, familiar manner, and fell upon my feet. The\n",
      "side of his head hit the wheel twice, and the end of what appeared\n",
      "a long cane clattered round and knocked over a little camp-stool. It\n",
      "looked as though after wrenching that thing from somebody ashore he had\n",
      "lost his balance in the effort. The thin smoke had blown away, we were\n",
      "clear of the snag, and looking ahead I could see that in another hundred\n",
      "yards or so I would be free to sheer off, away from the bank; but my\n",
      "feet felt so very warm and wet that I had to look down. The man had\n",
      "rolled on his back and stared straight up at me; both his hands clutched\n",
      "that cane. It was the shaft of a spear that, either thrown or lunged\n",
      "through the opening, had caught him in the side, just below the ribs;\n",
      "the blade had gone in out of sight, after making a frightful gash; my\n",
      "shoes were full; a pool of blood lay very still, gleaming dark-red under\n",
      "the wheel; his eyes shone with an amazing lustre. The fusillade burst\n",
      "out again. He looked at me anxiously, gripping the spear like something\n",
      "precious, with an air of being afraid I would try to take it away from\n",
      "him. I had to make an effort to free my eyes from his gaze and attend\n",
      "to the steering. With one hand I felt above my head for the line of\n",
      "the steam whistle, and jerked out screech after screech hurriedly. The\n",
      "tumult of angry and warlike yells was checked instantly, and then from\n",
      "the depths of the woods went out such a tremulous and prolonged wail of\n",
      "mournful fear and utter despair as may be imagined to follow the flight\n",
      "of the last hope from the earth. There was a great commotion in the\n",
      "bush; the shower of arrows stopped, a few dropping shots rang out\n",
      "sharply--then silence, in which the languid beat of the stern-wheel came\n",
      "plainly to my ears. I put the helm hard a-starboard at the moment when\n",
      "the pilgrim in pink pyjamas, very hot and agitated, appeared in the\n",
      "doorway. 'The manager sends me--' he began in an official tone, and\n",
      "stopped short. 'Good God!' he said, glaring at the wounded man.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We two whites stood over him, and his lustrous and inquiring glance\n",
      "enveloped us both. I declare it looked as though he would presently put\n",
      "to us some questions in an understandable language; but he died without\n",
      "uttering a sound, without moving a limb, without twitching a muscle.\n",
      "Only in the very last moment, as though in response to some sign we\n",
      "could not see, to some whisper we could not hear, he frowned heavily,\n",
      "and that frown gave to his black death-mask an inconceivably sombre,\n",
      "brooding, and menacing expression. The lustre of inquiring glance faded\n",
      "swiftly into vacant glassiness. 'Can you steer?' I asked the agent\n",
      "eagerly. He looked very dubious; but I made a grab at his arm, and he\n",
      "understood at once I meant him to steer whether or no. To tell you\n",
      "the truth, I was morbidly anxious to change my shoes and socks. 'He is\n",
      "dead,' murmured the fellow, immensely impressed. 'No doubt about it,'\n",
      "said I, tugging like mad at the shoe-laces. 'And by the way, I suppose\n",
      "Mr. Kurtz is dead as well by this time.'\n",
      "\n",
      "“For the moment that was the dominant thought. There was a sense of\n",
      "extreme disappointment, as though I had found out I had been striving\n",
      "after something altogether without a substance. I couldn't have been\n",
      "more disgusted if I had travelled all this way for the sole purpose of\n",
      "talking with Mr. Kurtz. Talking with... I flung one shoe overboard,\n",
      "and became aware that that was exactly what I had been looking forward\n",
      "to--a talk with Kurtz. I made the strange discovery that I had never\n",
      "imagined him as doing, you know, but as discoursing. I didn't say to\n",
      "myself, 'Now I will never see him,' or 'Now I will never shake him by\n",
      "the hand,' but, 'Now I will never hear him.' The man presented himself\n",
      "as a voice. Not of course that I did not connect him with some sort of\n",
      "action. Hadn't I been told in all the tones of jealousy and admiration\n",
      "that he had collected, bartered, swindled, or stolen more ivory than all\n",
      "the other agents together? That was not the point. The point was in his\n",
      "being a gifted creature, and that of all his gifts the one that stood\n",
      "out preeminently, that carried with it a sense of real presence, was his\n",
      "ability to talk, his words--the gift of expression, the bewildering,\n",
      "the illuminating, the most exalted and the most contemptible, the\n",
      "pulsating stream of light, or the deceitful flow from the heart of an\n",
      "impenetrable darkness.\n",

      "vanished, by means of some spear, arrow, or club. I will never hear that\n",
      "chap speak after all'--and my sorrow had a startling extravagance of\n",
      "emotion, even such as I had noticed in the howling sorrow of these\n",
      "savages in the bush. I couldn't have felt more of lonely desolation\n",
      "somehow, had I been robbed of a belief or had missed my destiny in\n",
      "life.... Why do you sigh in this beastly way, somebody? Absurd? Well,\n",
      "absurd. Good Lord! mustn't a man ever--Here, give me some tobacco.”...\n",

      "There was a pause of profound stillness, then a match flared, and\n",
      "Marlow's lean face appeared, worn, hollow, with downward folds and\n",
      "dropped eyelids, with an aspect of concentrated attention; and as he\n",
      "took vigorous draws at his pipe, it seemed to retreat and advance out of\n",
      "the night in the regular flicker of tiny flame. The match went out.\n",
      "\n",

      "you all are, each moored with two good addresses, like a hulk with\n",
      "two anchors, a butcher round one corner, a policeman round another,\n",
      "excellent appetites, and temperature normal--you hear--normal from\n",

      "of my fortitude. I was cut to the quick at the idea of having lost the\n",
      "inestimable privilege of listening to the gifted Kurtz. Of course I\n",
      "was wrong. The privilege was waiting for me. Oh, yes, I heard more than\n",
      "enough. And I was right, too. A voice. He was very little more than a\n",
      "voice. And I heard--him--it--this voice--other voices--all of them were\n",
      "so little more than voices--and the memory of that time itself lingers\n",
      "around me, impalpable, like a dying vibration of one immense jabber,\n",
      "silly, atrocious, sordid, savage, or simply mean, without any kind of\n",
      "sense. Voices, voices--even the girl herself--now--”\n",

      "gets worse. Oh, she had to be out of it. You should have heard the\n",
      "disinterred body of Mr. Kurtz saying, 'My Intended.' You would have\n",
      "perceived directly then how completely she was out of it. And the lofty\n",
      "frontal bone of Mr. Kurtz! They say the hair goes on growing sometimes,\n",
      "but this--ah--specimen, was impressively bald. The wilderness had\n",
      "patted him on the head, and, behold, it was like a ball--an ivory ball;\n",
      "it had caressed him, and--lo!--he had withered; it had taken him, loved\n",
      "him, embraced him, got into his veins, consumed his flesh, and sealed\n",
      "his soul to its own by the inconceivable ceremonies of some devilish\n",
      "initiation. He was its spoiled and pampered favourite. Ivory? I should\n",
      "think so. Heaps of it, stacks of it. The old mud shanty was bursting\n",
      "with it. You would think there was not a single tusk left either above\n",
      "or below the ground in the whole country. 'Mostly fossil,' the manager\n",
      "had remarked, disparagingly. It was no more fossil than I am; but they\n",
      "call it fossil when it is dug up. It appears these niggers do bury the\n",
      "tusks sometimes--but evidently they couldn't bury this parcel deep\n",
      "enough to save the gifted Mr. Kurtz from his fate. We filled the\n",
      "steamboat with it, and had to pile a lot on the deck. Thus he could\n",
      "see and enjoy as long as he could see, because the appreciation of this\n",
      "favour had remained with him to the last. You should have heard him say,\n",
      "'My ivory.' Oh, yes, I heard him. 'My Intended, my ivory, my station,\n",
      "my river, my--' everything belonged to him. It made me hold my breath\n",
      "in expectation of hearing the wilderness burst into a prodigious peal\n",
      "of laughter that would shake the fixed stars in their places. Everything\n",
      "belonged to him--but that was a trifle. The thing was to know what he\n",
      "belonged to, how many powers of darkness claimed him for their own. That\n",
      "was the reflection that made you creepy all over. It was impossible--it\n",
      "was not good for one either--trying to imagine. He had taken a high seat\n",
      "amongst the devils of the land--I mean literally. You can't understand.\n",
      "How could you?--with solid pavement under your feet, surrounded by kind\n",
      "neighbours ready to cheer you or to fall on you, stepping delicately\n",
      "between the butcher and the policeman, in the holy terror of scandal and\n",
      "gallows and lunatic asylums--how can you imagine what particular region\n",
      "of the first ages a man's untrammelled feet may take him into by the\n",
      "way of solitude--utter solitude without a policeman--by the way of\n",
      "silence--utter silence, where no warning voice of a kind neighbour can\n",
      "be heard whispering of public opinion? These little things make all the\n",
      "great difference. When they are gone you must fall back upon your own\n",
      "innate strength, upon your own capacity for faithfulness. Of course you\n",
      "may be too much of a fool to go wrong--too dull even to know you are\n",
      "being assaulted by the powers of darkness. I take it, no fool ever made\n",
      "a bargain for his soul with the devil; the fool is too much of a fool,\n",
      "or the devil too much of a devil--I don't know which. Or you may be such\n",
      "a thunderingly exalted creature as to be altogether deaf and blind to\n",
      "anything but heavenly sights and sounds. Then the earth for you is only\n",
      "a standing place--and whether to be like this is your loss or your gain\n",
      "I won't pretend to say. But most of us are neither one nor the other.\n",
      "The earth for us is a place to live in, where we must put up with\n",
      "sights, with sounds, with smells, too, by Jove!--breathe dead hippo,\n",
      "so to speak, and not be contaminated. And there, don't you see?\n",
      "Your strength comes in, the faith in your ability for the digging of\n",
      "unostentatious holes to bury the stuff in--your power of devotion,\n",
      "not to yourself, but to an obscure, back-breaking business. And that's\n",
      "difficult enough. Mind, I am not trying to excuse or even explain--I am\n",
      "trying to account to myself for--for--Mr. Kurtz--for the shade of Mr.\n",
      "Kurtz. This initiated wraith from the back of Nowhere honoured me with\n",
      "its amazing confidence before it vanished altogether. This was because\n",
      "it could speak English to me. The original Kurtz had been educated\n",
      "partly in England, and--as he was good enough to say himself--his\n",
      "sympathies were in the right place. His mother was half-English, his\n",
      "father was half-French. All Europe contributed to the making of Kurtz;\n",
      "and by and by I learned that, most appropriately, the International\n",
      "Society for the Suppression of Savage Customs had intrusted him with the\n",
      "making of a report, for its future guidance. And he had written it, too.\n",
      "I've seen it. I've read it. It was eloquent, vibrating with eloquence,\n",
      "but too high-strung, I think. Seventeen pages of close writing he had\n",
      "found time for! But this must have been before his--let us say--nerves,\n",
      "went wrong, and caused him to preside at certain midnight dances ending\n",
      "with unspeakable rites, which--as far as I reluctantly gathered\n",
      "from what I heard at various times--were offered up to him--do you\n",
      "understand?--to Mr. Kurtz himself. But it was a beautiful piece\n",
      "of writing. The opening paragraph, however, in the light of later\n",
      "information, strikes me now as ominous. He began with the argument\n",
      "that we whites, from the point of development we had arrived at, 'must\n",
      "necessarily appear to them [savages] in the nature of supernatural\n",
      "beings--we approach them with the might of a deity,' and so on, and so\n",
      "on. 'By the simple exercise of our will we can exert a power for good\n",
      "practically unbounded,' etc., etc. From that point he soared and took me\n",
      "with him. The peroration was magnificent, though difficult to remember,\n",
      "you know. It gave me the notion of an exotic Immensity ruled by an\n",
      "august Benevolence. It made me tingle with enthusiasm. This was the\n",
      "unbounded power of eloquence--of words--of burning noble words. There\n",
      "were no practical hints to interrupt the magic current of phrases,\n",
      "unless a kind of note at the foot of the last page, scrawled evidently\n",
      "much later, in an unsteady hand, may be regarded as the exposition of\n",
      "a method. It was very simple, and at the end of that moving appeal to\n",
      "every altruistic sentiment it blazed at you, luminous and terrifying,\n",
      "like a flash of lightning in a serene sky: 'Exterminate all the brutes!'\n",
      "The curious part was that he had apparently forgotten all about that\n",
      "valuable postscriptum, because, later on, when he in a sense came to\n",
      "himself, he repeatedly entreated me to take good care of 'my pamphlet'\n",
      "(he called it), as it was sure to have in the future a good influence\n",
      "upon his career. I had full information about all these things, and,\n",
      "besides, as it turned out, I was to have the care of his memory. I've\n",
      "done enough for it to give me the indisputable right to lay it, if I\n",
      "choose, for an everlasting rest in the dust-bin of progress, amongst\n",
      "all the sweepings and, figuratively speaking, all the dead cats of\n",
      "civilization. But then, you see, I can't choose. He won't be forgotten.\n",
      "Whatever he was, he was not common. He had the power to charm or\n",
      "frighten rudimentary souls into an aggravated witch-dance in his\n",
      "honour; he could also fill the small souls of the pilgrims with bitter\n",
      "misgivings: he had one devoted friend at least, and he had conquered\n",
      "one soul in the world that was neither rudimentary nor tainted with\n",
      "self-seeking. No; I can't forget him, though I am not prepared to affirm\n",
      "the fellow was exactly worth the life we lost in getting to him. I\n",
      "missed my late helmsman awfully--I missed him even while his body\n",
      "was still lying in the pilot-house. Perhaps you will think it passing\n",
      "strange this regret for a savage who was no more account than a grain of\n",
      "sand in a black Sahara. Well, don't you see, he had done something, he\n",
      "had steered; for months I had him at my back--a help--an instrument. It\n",
      "was a kind of partnership. He steered for me--I had to look after him, I\n",
      "worried about his deficiencies, and thus a subtle bond had been created,\n",
      "of which I only became aware when it was suddenly broken. And the\n",
      "intimate profundity of that look he gave me when he received his hurt\n",
      "remains to this day in my memory--like a claim of distant kinship\n",
      "affirmed in a supreme moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Poor fool! If he had only left that shutter alone. He had no restraint,\n",
      "no restraint--just like Kurtz--a tree swayed by the wind. As soon as\n",
      "I had put on a dry pair of slippers, I dragged him out, after first\n",
      "jerking the spear out of his side, which operation I confess I performed\n",
      "with my eyes shut tight. His heels leaped together over the little\n",
      "doorstep; his shoulders were pressed to my breast; I hugged him from\n",
      "behind desperately. Oh! he was heavy, heavy; heavier than any man on\n",
      "earth, I should imagine. Then without more ado I tipped him overboard.\n",
      "The current snatched him as though he had been a wisp of grass, and I\n",
      "saw the body roll over twice before I lost sight of it for ever. All the\n",
      "pilgrims and the manager were then congregated on the awning-deck\n",
      "about the pilot-house, chattering at each other like a flock of excited\n",
      "magpies, and there was a scandalized murmur at my heartless promptitude.\n",
      "What they wanted to keep that body hanging about for I can't guess.\n",
      "Embalm it, maybe. But I had also heard another, and a very ominous,\n",
      "murmur on the deck below. My friends the wood-cutters were likewise\n",
      "scandalized, and with a better show of reason--though I admit that the\n",
      "reason itself was quite inadmissible. Oh, quite! I had made up my mind\n",
      "that if my late helmsman was to be eaten, the fishes alone should have\n",
      "him. He had been a very second-rate helmsman while alive, but now he was\n",
      "dead he might have become a first-class temptation, and possibly cause\n",
      "some startling trouble. Besides, I was anxious to take the wheel, the\n",
      "man in pink pyjamas showing himself a hopeless duffer at the business.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This I did directly the simple funeral was over. We were going\n",
      "half-speed, keeping right in the middle of the stream, and I listened\n",
      "to the talk about me. They had given up Kurtz, they had given up the\n",
      "station; Kurtz was dead, and the station had been burnt--and so on--and\n",
      "so on. The red-haired pilgrim was beside himself with the thought that\n",
      "at least this poor Kurtz had been properly avenged. 'Say! We must have\n",
      "made a glorious slaughter of them in the bush. Eh? What do you think?\n",
      "Say?' He positively danced, the bloodthirsty little gingery beggar.\n",
      "And he had nearly fainted when he saw the wounded man! I could not help\n",
      "saying, 'You made a glorious lot of smoke, anyhow.' I had seen, from the\n",
      "way the tops of the bushes rustled and flew, that almost all the shots\n",
      "had gone too high. You can't hit anything unless you take aim and fire\n",
      "from the shoulder; but these chaps fired from the hip with their eyes\n",
      "shut. The retreat, I maintained--and I was right--was caused by the\n",
      "screeching of the steam whistle. Upon this they forgot Kurtz, and began\n",
      "to howl at me with indignant protests.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The manager stood by the wheel murmuring confidentially about the\n",
      "necessity of getting well away down the river before dark at all events,\n",
      "when I saw in the distance a clearing on the riverside and the outlines\n",
      "of some sort of building. 'What's this?' I asked. He clapped his hands\n",
      "in wonder. 'The station!' he cried. I edged in at once, still going\n",
      "half-speed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Through my glasses I saw the slope of a hill interspersed with rare\n",
      "trees and perfectly free from undergrowth. A long decaying building on\n",
      "the summit was half buried in the high grass; the large holes in the\n",
      "peaked roof gaped black from afar; the jungle and the woods made a\n",
      "background. There was no enclosure or fence of any kind; but there had\n",
      "been one apparently, for near the house half-a-dozen slim posts remained\n",
      "in a row, roughly trimmed, and with their upper ends ornamented with\n",
      "round carved balls. The rails, or whatever there had been between, had\n",
      "disappeared. Of course the forest surrounded all that. The river-bank\n",
      "was clear, and on the waterside I saw a white man under a hat like a\n",
      "cart-wheel beckoning persistently with his whole arm. Examining the\n",
      "edge of the forest above and below, I was almost certain I could see\n",
      "movements--human forms gliding here and there. I steamed past prudently,\n",
      "then stopped the engines and let her drift down. The man on the shore\n",
      "began to shout, urging us to land. 'We have been attacked,' screamed\n",
      "the manager. 'I know--I know. It's all right,' yelled back the other, as\n",

      "seen somewhere. As I manoeuvred to get alongside, I was asking myself,\n",
      "'What does this fellow look like?' Suddenly I got it. He looked like\n",
      "a harlequin. His clothes had been made of some stuff that was brown\n",
      "holland probably, but it was covered with patches all over, with bright\n",
      "patches, blue, red, and yellow--patches on the back, patches on the\n",
      "front, patches on elbows, on knees; coloured binding around his jacket,\n",
      "scarlet edging at the bottom of his trousers; and the sunshine made him\n",
      "look extremely gay and wonderfully neat withal, because you could see\n",
      "how beautifully all this patching had been done. A beardless, boyish\n",
      "face, very fair, no features to speak of, nose peeling, little blue\n",
      "eyes, smiles and frowns chasing each other over that open countenance\n",
      "like sunshine and shadow on a wind-swept plain. 'Look out, captain!' he\n",
      "cried; 'there's a snag lodged in here last night.' What! Another snag? I\n",
      "confess I swore shamefully. I had nearly holed my cripple, to finish off\n",
      "that charming trip. The harlequin on the bank turned his little pug-nose\n",
      "up to me. 'You English?' he asked, all smiles. 'Are you?' I shouted from\n",

      "by various causes. He had, as he informed me proudly, managed to nurse\n",
      "Kurtz through two illnesses (he alluded to it as you would to some risky\n",

      "forest. 'Very often coming to this station, I had to wait days and\n",
      "days before he would turn up,' he said. 'Ah, it was worth waiting\n",
      "for!--sometimes.' 'What was he doing? exploring or what?' I asked. 'Oh,\n",
      "yes, of course'; he had discovered lots of villages, a lake, too--he\n",
      "did not know exactly in what direction; it was dangerous to inquire\n",
      "too much--but mostly his expeditions had been for ivory. 'But he had no\n",
      "goods to trade with by that time,' I objected. 'There's a good lot of\n",
      "cartridges left even yet,' he answered, looking away. 'To speak plainly,\n",
      "he raided the country,' I said. He nodded. 'Not alone, surely!' He\n",
      "muttered something about the villages round that lake. 'Kurtz got the\n",
      "tribe to follow him, did he?' I suggested. He fidgeted a little. 'They\n",

      "I looked at him searchingly. It was curious to see his mingled eagerness\n",
      "and reluctance to speak of Kurtz. The man filled his life, occupied his\n",
      "thoughts, swayed his emotions. 'What can you expect?' he burst out; 'he\n",
      "came to them with thunder and lightning, you know--and they had never\n",
      "seen anything like it--and very terrible. He could be very terrible.\n",
      "You can't judge Mr. Kurtz as you would an ordinary man. No, no, no!\n",

      "near my house gave me. You see I used to shoot game for them. Well,\n",
      "he wanted it, and wouldn't hear reason. He declared he would shoot me\n",
      "unless I gave him the ivory and then cleared out of the country, because\n",
      "he could do so, and had a fancy for it, and there was nothing on earth\n",
      "to prevent him killing whom he jolly well pleased. And it was true, too.\n",
      "I gave him the ivory. What did I care! But I didn't clear out. No, no. I\n",
      "couldn't leave him. I had to be careful, of course, till we got friendly\n",
      "again for a time. He had his second illness then. Afterwards I had to\n",
      "keep out of the way; but I didn't mind. He was living for the most part\n",
      "in those villages on the lake. When he came down to the river, sometimes\n",
      "he would take to me, and sometimes it was better for me to be careful.\n",
      "This man suffered too much. He hated all this, and somehow he couldn't\n",
      "get away. When I had a chance I begged him to try and leave while there\n",
      "was time; I offered to go back with him. And he would say yes, and then\n",
      "he would remain; go off on another ivory hunt; disappear for weeks;\n",
      "forget himself amongst these people--forget himself--you know.' 'Why!\n",
      "he's mad,' I said. He protested indignantly. Mr. Kurtz couldn't be mad.\n",
      "If I had heard him talk, only two days ago, I wouldn't dare hint at such\n",
      "a thing.... I had taken up my binoculars while we talked, and was\n",
      "looking at the shore, sweeping the limit of the forest at each side and\n",
      "at the back of the house. The consciousness of there being people in\n",
      "that bush, so silent, so quiet--as silent and quiet as the ruined house\n",
      "on the hill--made me uneasy. There was no sign on the face of nature\n",
      "of this amazing tale that was not so much told as suggested to me in\n",
      "desolate exclamations, completed by shrugs, in interrupted phrases, in\n",
      "hints ending in deep sighs. The woods were unmoved, like a mask--heavy,\n",
      "like the closed door of a prison--they looked with their air of hidden\n",
      "knowledge, of patient expectation, of unapproachable silence. The\n",
      "Russian was explaining to me that it was only lately that Mr. Kurtz had\n",
      "come down to the river, bringing along with him all the fighting men of\n",
      "that lake tribe. He had been absent for several months--getting himself\n",
      "adored, I suppose--and had come down unexpectedly, with the intention\n",
      "to all appearance of making a raid either across the river or down\n",
      "stream. Evidently the appetite for more ivory had got the better of\n",
      "the--what shall I say?--less material aspirations. However he had\n",
      "got much worse suddenly. 'I heard he was lying helpless, and so I came\n",
      "up--took my chance,' said the Russian. 'Oh, he is bad, very bad.' I\n",
      "directed my glass to the house. There were no signs of life, but there\n",
      "was the ruined roof, the long mud wall peeping above the grass, with\n",
      "three little square window-holes, no two of the same size; all this\n",
      "brought within reach of my hand, as it were. And then I made a brusque\n",
      "movement, and one of the remaining posts of that vanished fence leaped\n",
      "up in the field of my glass. You remember I told you I had been struck\n",
      "at the distance by certain attempts at ornamentation, rather remarkable\n",
      "in the ruinous aspect of the place. Now I had suddenly a nearer view,\n",
      "and its first result was to make me throw my head back as if before a\n",
      "blow. Then I went carefully from post to post with my glass, and I saw\n",
      "my mistake. These round knobs were not ornamental but symbolic; they\n",
      "were expressive and puzzling, striking and disturbing--food for thought\n",
      "and also for vultures if there had been any looking down from the sky;\n",
      "but at all events for such ants as were industrious enough to ascend\n",
      "the pole. They would have been even more impressive, those heads on the\n",
      "stakes, if their faces had not been turned to the house. Only one, the\n",
      "first I had made out, was facing my way. I was not so shocked as you may\n",
      "think. The start back I had given was really nothing but a movement\n",
      "of surprise. I had expected to see a knob of wood there, you know. I\n",
      "returned deliberately to the first I had seen--and there it was, black,\n",
      "dried, sunken, with closed eyelids--a head that seemed to sleep at the\n",
      "top of that pole, and, with the shrunken dry lips showing a narrow\n",
      "white line of the teeth, was smiling, too, smiling continuously at some\n",
      "endless and jocose dream of that eternal slumber.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am not disclosing any trade secrets. In fact, the manager said\n",
      "afterwards that Mr. Kurtz's methods had ruined the district. I have no\n",
      "opinion on that point, but I want you clearly to understand that there\n",
      "was nothing exactly profitable in these heads being there. They only\n",
      "showed that Mr. Kurtz lacked restraint in the gratification of his\n",
      "various lusts, that there was something wanting in him--some small\n",
      "matter which, when the pressing need arose, could not be found under\n",
      "his magnificent eloquence. Whether he knew of this deficiency himself I\n",
      "can't say. I think the knowledge came to him at last--only at the very\n",
      "last. But the wilderness had found him out early, and had taken on him a\n",
      "terrible vengeance for the fantastic invasion. I think it had whispered\n",
      "to him things about himself which he did not know, things of which he\n",
      "had no conception till he took counsel with this great solitude--and the\n",
      "whisper had proved irresistibly fascinating. It echoed loudly within him\n",
      "because he was hollow at the core.... I put down the glass, and the\n",
      "head that had appeared near enough to be spoken to seemed at once to\n",
      "have leaped away from me into inaccessible distance.\n",
      "\n",

      "indistinct voice he began to assure me he had not dared to take\n",
      "these--say, symbols--down. He was not afraid of the natives; they would\n",
      "not stir till Mr. Kurtz gave the word. His ascendancy was extraordinary.\n",
      "The camps of these people surrounded the place, and the chiefs came\n",
      "every day to see him. They would crawl.... 'I don't want to know\n",
      "anything of the ceremonies used when approaching Mr. Kurtz,' I shouted.\n",
      "Curious, this feeling that came over me that such details would be more\n",
      "intolerable than those heads drying on the stakes under Mr. Kurtz's\n",
      "windows. After all, that was only a savage sight, while I seemed at\n",
      "one bound to have been transported into some lightless region of subtle\n",
      "horrors, where pure, uncomplicated savagery was a positive relief, being\n",
      "something that had a right to exist--obviously--in the sunshine. The\n",
      "young man looked at me with surprise. I suppose it did not occur to\n",
      "him that Mr. Kurtz was no idol of mine. He forgot I hadn't heard any of\n",
      "these splendid monologues on, what was it? on love, justice, conduct\n",
      "of life--or what not. If it had come to crawling before Mr. Kurtz, he\n",
      "crawled as much as the veriest savage of them all. I had no idea of the\n",
      "conditions, he said: these heads were the heads of rebels. I shocked him\n",
      "excessively by laughing. Rebels! What would be the next definition I\n",
      "was to hear? There had been enemies, criminals, workers--and these\n",
      "were rebels. Those rebellious heads looked very subdued to me on their\n",
      "sticks. 'You don't know how such a life tries a man like Kurtz,' cried\n",
      "Kurtz's last disciple. 'Well, and you?' I said. 'I! I! I am a simple\n",
      "man. I have no great thoughts. I want nothing from anybody. How can\n",
      "you compare me to...?' His feelings were too much for speech, and\n",
      "suddenly he broke down. 'I don't understand,' he groaned. 'I've been\n",
      "doing my best to keep him alive, and that's enough. I had no hand in\n",
      "all this. I have no abilities. There hasn't been a drop of medicine or a\n",
      "mouthful of invalid food for months here. He was shamefully abandoned.\n",
      "A man like this, with such ideas. Shamefully! Shamefully! I--I--haven't\n",
      "slept for the last ten nights...'\n",

      "the forest had slipped downhill while we talked, had gone far beyond\n",
      "the ruined hovel, beyond the symbolic row of stakes. All this was in the\n",
      "gloom, while we down there were yet in the sunshine, and the stretch\n",
      "of the river abreast of the clearing glittered in a still and dazzling\n",
      "splendour, with a murky and overshadowed bend above and below. Not a\n",
      "living soul was seen on the shore. The bushes did not rustle.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Suddenly round the corner of the house a group of men appeared, as\n",
      "though they had come up from the ground. They waded waist-deep in the\n",
      "grass, in a compact body, bearing an improvised stretcher in their\n",
      "midst. Instantly, in the emptiness of the landscape, a cry arose whose\n",
      "shrillness pierced the still air like a sharp arrow flying straight to\n",
      "the very heart of the land; and, as if by enchantment, streams of human\n",
      "beings--of naked human beings--with spears in their hands, with bows,\n",
      "with shields, with wild glances and savage movements, were poured into\n",
      "the clearing by the dark-faced and pensive forest. The bushes shook, the\n",

      "immobility.\n",
      "\n",
      "“'Now, if he does not say the right thing to them we are all done for,'\n",

      "the stretcher sit up, lank and with an uplifted arm, above the shoulders\n",
      "of the bearers. 'Let us hope that the man who can talk so well of love\n",
      "in general will find some particular reason to spare us this time,' I\n",
      "said. I resented bitterly the absurd danger of our situation, as if\n",
      "to be at the mercy of that atrocious phantom had been a dishonouring\n",
      "necessity. I could not hear a sound, but through my glasses I saw the\n",
      "thin arm extended commandingly, the lower jaw moving, the eyes of\n",
      "that apparition shining darkly far in its bony head that nodded with\n",
      "grotesque jerks. Kurtz--Kurtz--that means short in German--don't it?\n",
      "Well, the name was as true as everything else in his life--and death.\n",
      "He looked at least seven feet long. His covering had fallen off, and his\n",
      "body emerged from it pitiful and appalling as from a winding-sheet. I\n",
      "could see the cage of his ribs all astir, the bones of his arm waving.\n",
      "It was as though an animated image of death carved out of old ivory had\n",
      "been shaking its hand with menaces at a motionless crowd of men made of\n",
      "dark and glittering bronze. I saw him open his mouth wide--it gave him\n",
      "a weirdly voracious aspect, as though he had wanted to swallow all the\n",
      "air, all the earth, all the men before him. A deep voice reached\n",
      "me faintly. He must have been shouting. He fell back suddenly. The\n",
      "stretcher shook as the bearers staggered forward again, and almost at\n",
      "the same time I noticed that the crowd of savages was vanishing without\n",
      "any perceptible movement of retreat, as if the forest that had ejected\n",
      "these beings so suddenly had drawn them in again as the breath is drawn\n",
      "in a long aspiration.\n",

      "“Some of the pilgrims behind the stretcher carried his\n",
      "arms--two shot-guns, a heavy rifle, and a light revolver-carbine--the\n",
      "thunderbolts of that pitiful Jupiter. The manager bent over him\n",
      "murmuring as he walked beside his head. They laid him down in one of the\n",
      "little cabins--just a room for a bed place and a camp-stool or two,\n",
      "you know. We had brought his belated correspondence, and a lot of torn\n",

      "without effort, almost without the trouble of moving his lips, amazed\n",

      "pockets (bright red) was bulging with cartridges, from the other (dark\n",

      "make me get up for the purpose of having a look round. On the hill a\n",
      "big fire burned, illuminating fitfully a crooked corner of the\n",
      "station-house. One of the agents with a picket of a few of our blacks,\n",
      "armed for the purpose, was keeping guard over the ivory; but deep within\n",

      "many men chanting each to himself some weird incantation came out from\n",
      "the black, flat wall of the woods as the humming of bees comes out of\n",
      "a hive, and had a strange narcotic effect upon my half-awake senses.\n",
      "I believe I dozed off leaning over the rail, till an abrupt burst of\n",
      "yells, an overwhelming outbreak of a pent-up and mysterious frenzy, woke\n",
      "me up in a bewildered wonder. It was cut short all at once, and the\n",
      "low droning went on with an effect of audible and soothing silence. I\n",
      "glanced casually into the little cabin. A light was burning within, but\n",
      "Mr. Kurtz was not there.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think I would have raised an outcry if I had believed my eyes. But I\n",
      "didn't believe them at first--the thing seemed so impossible. The fact\n",
      "is I was completely unnerved by a sheer blank fright, pure abstract\n",
      "terror, unconnected with any distinct shape of physical danger. What\n",
      "made this emotion so overpowering was--how shall I define it?--the\n",
      "moral shock I received, as if something altogether monstrous,\n",
      "intolerable to thought and odious to the soul, had been thrust upon me\n",
      "unexpectedly. This lasted of course the merest fraction of a second, and\n",
      "then the usual sense of commonplace, deadly danger, the possibility of\n",
      "a sudden onslaught and massacre, or something of the kind, which I saw\n",
      "impending, was positively welcome and composing. It pacified me, in\n",
      "fact, so much that I did not raise an alarm.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There was an agent buttoned up inside an ulster and sleeping on a chair\n",

      "I did not betray Mr. Kurtz--it was ordered I should never betray him--it\n",
      "was written I should be loyal to the nightmare of my choice. I was\n",
      "anxious to deal with this shadow by myself alone--and to this day I\n",

      "blackness of that experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "“As soon as I got on the bank I saw a trail--a broad trail through the\n",
      "grass. I remember the exultation with which I said to myself, 'He can't\n",
      "walk--he is crawling on all-fours--I've got him.' The grass was wet\n",
      "with dew. I strode rapidly with clenched fists. I fancy I had some vague\n",
      "notion of falling upon him and giving him a drubbing. I don't know. I\n",
      "had some imbecile thoughts. The knitting old woman with the cat obtruded\n",
      "herself upon my memory as a most improper person to be sitting at the\n",
      "other end of such an affair. I saw a row of pilgrims squirting lead in\n",
      "the air out of Winchesters held to the hip. I thought I would never get\n",
      "back to the steamer, and imagined myself living alone and unarmed in the\n",
      "woods to an advanced age. Such silly things--you know. And I remember\n",
      "I confounded the beat of the drum with the beating of my heart, and was\n",
      "pleased at its calm regularity.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I kept to the track though--then stopped to listen. The night was very\n",
      "clear; a dark blue space, sparkling with dew and starlight, in which\n",
      "black things stood very still. I thought I could see a kind of motion\n",
      "ahead of me. I was strangely cocksure of everything that night. I\n",
      "actually left the track and ran in a wide semicircle (I verily believe\n",
      "chuckling to myself) so as to get in front of that stir, of that motion\n",

      "\n",
      "“I came upon him, and, if he had not heard me coming, I would have\n",
      "fallen over him, too, but he got up in time. He rose, unsteady, long,\n",
      "pale, indistinct, like a vapour exhaled by the earth, and swayed\n",
      "slightly, misty and silent before me; while at my back the fires loomed\n",
      "between the trees, and the murmur of many voices issued from the forest.\n",
      "I had cut him off cleverly; but when actually confronting him I seemed\n",
      "to come to my senses, I saw the danger in its right proportion. It was\n",
      "by no means over yet. Suppose he began to shout? Though he could hardly\n",
      "stand, there was still plenty of vigour in his voice. 'Go away--hide\n",
      "yourself,' he said, in that profound tone. It was very awful. I glanced\n",
      "back. We were within thirty yards from the nearest fire. A black figure\n",
      "stood up, strode on long black legs, waving long black arms, across the\n",
      "glow. It had horns--antelope horns, I think--on its head. Some sorcerer,\n",
      "some witch-man, no doubt: it looked fiendlike enough. 'Do you know what\n",
      "you are doing?' I whispered. 'Perfectly,' he answered, raising his voice\n",
      "for that single word: it sounded to me far off and yet loud, like a hail\n",
      "through a speaking-trumpet. 'If he makes a row we are lost,' I thought\n",
      "to myself. This clearly was not a case for fisticuffs, even apart from\n",
      "the very natural aversion I had to beat that Shadow--this wandering and\n",
      "tormented thing. 'You will be lost,' I said--'utterly lost.' One gets\n",
      "sometimes such a flash of inspiration, you know. I did say the right\n",
      "thing, though indeed he could not have been more irretrievably lost than\n",
      "he was at this very moment, when the foundations of our intimacy were\n",
      "being laid--to endure--to endure--even to the end--even beyond.\n",
      "\n",
      "“'I had immense plans,' he muttered irresolutely. 'Yes,' said I; 'but if\n",
      "you try to shout I'll smash your head with--' There was not a stick or\n",
      "a stone near. 'I will throttle you for good,' I corrected myself. 'I was\n",
      "on the threshold of great things,' he pleaded, in a voice of longing,\n",
      "with a wistfulness of tone that made my blood run cold. 'And now for\n",
      "this stupid scoundrel--' 'Your success in Europe is assured in any\n",
      "case,' I affirmed steadily. I did not want to have the throttling of\n",
      "him, you understand--and indeed it would have been very little use for\n",
      "any practical purpose. I tried to break the spell--the heavy, mute spell\n",
      "of the wilderness--that seemed to draw him to its pitiless breast\n",
      "by the awakening of forgotten and brutal instincts, by the memory of\n",
      "gratified and monstrous passions. This alone, I was convinced, had\n",
      "driven him out to the edge of the forest, to the bush, towards the gleam\n",
      "of fires, the throb of drums, the drone of weird incantations; this\n",
      "alone had beguiled his unlawful soul beyond the bounds of permitted\n",
      "aspirations. And, don't you see, the terror of the position was not in\n",
      "being knocked on the head--though I had a very lively sense of that\n",
      "danger, too--but in this, that I had to deal with a being to whom I\n",
      "could not appeal in the name of anything high or low. I had, even like\n",
      "the niggers, to invoke him--himself--his own exalted and incredible\n",
      "degradation. There was nothing either above or below him, and I knew\n",
      "it. He had kicked himself loose of the earth. Confound the man! he had\n",
      "kicked the very earth to pieces. He was alone, and I before him did\n",
      "not know whether I stood on the ground or floated in the air. I've been\n",

      "dreams, of phrases spoken in nightmares. Soul! If anybody ever struggled\n",

      "was my only chance--barring, of course, the killing him there and then,\n",
      "which wasn't so good, on account of unavoidable noise. But his soul was\n",
      "mad. Being alone in the wilderness, it had looked within itself, and, by\n",
      "heavens! I tell you, it had gone mad. I had--for my sins, I suppose--to\n",
      "go through the ordeal of looking into it myself. No eloquence could\n",
      "have been so withering to one's belief in mankind as his final burst of\n",
      "sincerity. He struggled with himself, too. I saw it--I heard it. I saw\n",
      "the inconceivable mystery of a soul that knew no restraint, no faith,\n",
      "and no fear, yet struggling blindly with itself. I kept my head pretty\n",

      "eddy in the mass of human bodies, and the woman with helmeted head and\n",
      "tawny cheeks rushed out to the very brink of the stream. She put out her\n",
      "hands, shouted something, and all that wild mob took up the shout in a\n",
      "roaring chorus of articulated, rapid, breathless utterance.\n",
      "\n",

      "smile, a smile of indefinable meaning, appear on his colourless lips\n",
      "that a moment after twitched convulsively. 'Do I not?' he said slowly,\n",
      "gasping, as if the words had been torn out of him by a supernatural\n",
      "power.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I pulled the string of the whistle, and I did this because I saw the\n",
      "pilgrims on deck getting out their rifles with an air of anticipating a\n",
      "jolly lark. At the sudden screech there was a movement of abject terror\n",
      "through that wedged mass of bodies. 'Don't! don't you frighten them\n",
      "away,' cried some one on deck disconsolately. I pulled the string\n",
      "time after time. They broke and ran, they leaped, they crouched, they\n",
      "swerved, they dodged the flying terror of the sound. The three red chaps\n",
      "had fallen flat, face down on the shore, as though they had been shot\n",
      "dead. Only the barbarous and superb woman did not so much as flinch,\n",
      "and stretched tragically her bare arms after us over the sombre and\n",

      "down towards the sea with twice the speed of our upward progress; and\n",
      "Kurtz's life was running swiftly, too, ebbing, ebbing out of his heart\n",
      "into the sea of inexorable time. The manager was very placid, he had\n",
      "no vital anxieties now, he took us both in with a comprehensive and\n",
      "satisfied glance: the 'affair' had come off as well as could be wished.\n",
      "I saw the time approaching when I would be left alone of the party of\n",
      "'unsound method.' The pilgrims looked upon me with disfavour. I was,\n",
      "so to speak, numbered with the dead. It is strange how I accepted this\n",
      "unforeseen partnership, this choice of nightmares forced upon me in the\n",
      "tenebrous land invaded by these mean and greedy phantoms.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Kurtz discoursed. A voice! a voice! It rang deep to the very last. It\n",
      "survived his strength to hide in the magnificent folds of eloquence the\n",
      "barren darkness of his heart. Oh, he struggled! he struggled! The wastes\n",
      "of his weary brain were haunted by shadowy images now--images of wealth\n",
      "and fame revolving obsequiously round his unextinguishable gift of noble\n",
      "and lofty expression. My Intended, my station, my career, my\n",
      "ideas--these were the subjects for the occasional utterances of elevated\n",
      "sentiments. The shade of the original Kurtz frequented the bedside of\n",
      "the hollow sham, whose fate it was to be buried presently in the mould\n",
      "of primeval earth. But both the diabolic love and the unearthly hate of\n",
      "the mysteries it had penetrated fought for the possession of that\n",

      "distinction, of all the appearances of success and power.\n",

      "something that is really profitable, and then there will be no limits to\n",
      "the recognition of your ability,' he would say. 'Of course you must take\n",
      "care of the motives--right motives--always.' The long reaches that were\n",
      "like one and the same reach, monotonous bends that were exactly alike,\n",
      "slipped past the steamer with their multitude of secular trees looking\n",
      "patiently after this grimy fragment of another world, the forerunner\n",
      "of change, of conquest, of trade, of massacres, of blessings. I looked\n",
      "ahead--piloting. 'Close the shutter,' said Kurtz suddenly one day; 'I\n",

      "He was lying on his back with closed eyes, and I withdrew quietly, but I\n",
      "heard him mutter, 'Live rightly, die, die...' I listened. There was\n",
      "nothing more. Was he rehearsing some speech in his sleep, or was it a\n",
      "fragment of a phrase from some newspaper article? He had been writing\n",

      "terror--of an intense and hopeless despair. Did he live his life again\n",
      "in every detail of desire, temptation, and surrender during that supreme\n",
      "moment of complete knowledge? He cried in a whisper at some image, at\n",

      "eat much. There was a lamp in there--light, don't you know--and outside\n",
      "it was so beastly, beastly dark. I went no more near the remarkable man\n",

      "not. I remained to dream the nightmare out to the end, and to show my\n",
      "loyalty to Kurtz once more. Destiny. My destiny! Droll thing life\n",
      "is--that mysterious arrangement of merciless logic for a futile purpose.\n",
      "The most you can hope from it is some knowledge of yourself--that comes\n",
      "too late--a crop of unextinguishable regrets. I have wrestled with\n",
      "death. It is the most unexciting contest you can imagine. It takes place\n",
      "in an impalpable greyness, with nothing underfoot, with nothing around,\n",
      "without spectators, without clamour, without glory, without the great\n",
      "desire of victory, without the great fear of defeat, in a sickly\n",
      "atmosphere of tepid scepticism, without much belief in your own right,\n",
      "and still less in that of your adversary. If such is the form of\n",
      "ultimate wisdom, then life is a greater riddle than some of us think it\n",
      "to be. I was within a hair's breadth of the last opportunity for\n",
      "pronouncement, and I found with humiliation that probably I would have\n",
      "nothing to say. This is the reason why I affirm that Kurtz was a\n",
      "remarkable man. He had something to say. He said it. Since I had peeped\n",
      "over the edge myself, I understand better the meaning of his stare, that\n",
      "could not see the flame of the candle, but was wide enough to embrace\n",
      "the whole universe, piercing enough to penetrate all the hearts that\n",
      "beat in the darkness. He had summed up--he had judged. 'The horror!' He\n",
      "was a remarkable man. After all, this was the expression of some sort of\n",
      "belief; it had candour, it had conviction, it had a vibrating note of\n",
      "revolt in its whisper, it had the appalling face of a glimpsed\n",
      "truth--the strange commingling of desire and hate. And it is not my own\n",
      "extremity I remember best--a vision of greyness without form filled\n",
      "with physical pain, and a careless contempt for the evanescence of all\n",
      "things--even of this pain itself. No! It is his extremity that I seem to\n",
      "have lived through. True, he had made that last stride, he had stepped\n",
      "over the edge, while I had been permitted to draw back my hesitating\n",
      "foot. And perhaps in this is the whole difference; perhaps all the\n",
      "wisdom, and all truth, and all sincerity, are just compressed into that\n",
      "inappreciable moment of time in which we step over the threshold of the\n",
      "invisible. Perhaps! I like to think my summing-up would not have been a\n",
      "word of careless contempt. Better his cry--much better. It was an\n",
      "affirmation, a moral victory paid for by innumerable defeats, by\n",
      "abominable terrors, by abominable satisfactions. But it was a victory!\n",
      "That is why I have remained loyal to Kurtz to the last, and even beyond,\n",
      "when a long time after I heard once more, not his own voice, but the\n",
      "echo of his magnificent eloquence thrown to me from a soul as\n",
      "translucently pure as a cliff of crystal.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, they did not bury me, though there is a period of time which I\n",
      "remember mistily, with a shuddering wonder, like a passage through some\n",
      "inconceivable world that had no hope in it and no desire. I found myself\n",
      "back in the sepulchral city resenting the sight of people hurrying\n",
      "through the streets to filch a little money from each other, to devour\n",
      "their infamous cookery, to gulp their unwholesome beer, to dream their\n",
      "insignificant and silly dreams. They trespassed upon my thoughts. They\n",
      "were intruders whose knowledge of life was to me an irritating pretence,\n",
      "because I felt so sure they could not possibly know the things I knew.\n",
      "Their bearing, which was simply the bearing of commonplace individuals\n",
      "going about their business in the assurance of perfect safety, was\n",
      "offensive to me like the outrageous flauntings of folly in the face of\n",
      "a danger it is unable to comprehend. I had no particular desire to\n",
      "enlighten them, but I had some difficulty in restraining myself from\n",
      "laughing in their faces so full of stupid importance. I daresay I was\n",
      "not very well at that time. I tottered about the streets--there were\n",
      "various affairs to settle--grinning bitterly at perfectly respectable\n",
      "persons. I admit my behaviour was inexcusable, but then my temperature\n",
      "was seldom normal in these days. My dear aunt's endeavours to 'nurse up\n",
      "my strength' seemed altogether beside the mark. It was not my strength\n",
      "that wanted nursing, it was my imagination that wanted soothing. I kept\n",
      "the bundle of papers given me by Kurtz, not knowing exactly what to do\n",
      "with it. His mother had died lately, watched over, as I was told, by\n",
      "his Intended. A clean-shaved man, with an official manner and wearing\n",
      "gold-rimmed spectacles, called on me one day and made inquiries, at\n",
      "first circuitous, afterwards suavely pressing, about what he was pleased\n",
      "to denominate certain 'documents.' I was not surprised, because I had\n",
      "had two rows with the manager on the subject out there. I had refused\n",
      "to give up the smallest scrap out of that package, and I took the same\n",
      "attitude with the spectacled man. He became darkly menacing at last,\n",
      "and with much heat argued that the Company had the right to every bit of\n",
      "information about its 'territories.' And said he, 'Mr. Kurtz's\n",
      "knowledge of unexplored regions must have been necessarily extensive\n",
      "and peculiar--owing to his great abilities and to the deplorable\n",
      "circumstances in which he had been placed: therefore--' I assured him\n",
      "Mr. Kurtz's knowledge, however extensive, did not bear upon the problems\n",
      "of commerce or administration. He invoked then the name of science. 'It\n",
      "would be an incalculable loss if,' etc., etc. I offered him the report\n",
      "on the 'Suppression of Savage Customs,' with the postscriptum torn\n",
      "off. He took it up eagerly, but ended by sniffing at it with an air\n",
      "of contempt. 'This is not what we had a right to expect,' he remarked.\n",
      "'Expect nothing else,' I said. 'There are only private letters.' He\n",
      "withdrew upon some threat of legal proceedings, and I saw him no more;\n",
      "but another fellow, calling himself Kurtz's cousin, appeared two days\n",
      "later, and was anxious to hear all the details about his dear relative's\n",
      "last moments. Incidentally he gave me to understand that Kurtz had\n",
      "been essentially a great musician. 'There was the making of an immense\n",
      "success,' said the man, who was an organist, I believe, with lank grey\n",
      "hair flowing over a greasy coat-collar. I had no reason to doubt\n",
      "his statement; and to this day I am unable to say what was Kurtz's\n",
      "profession, whether he ever had any--which was the greatest of his\n",
      "talents. I had taken him for a painter who wrote for the papers, or else\n",
      "for a journalist who could paint--but even the cousin (who took snuff\n",
      "during the interview) could not tell me what he had been--exactly. He\n",
      "was a universal genius--on that point I agreed with the old chap, who\n",
      "thereupon blew his nose noisily into a large cotton handkerchief and\n",
      "withdrew in senile agitation, bearing off some family letters and\n",
      "memoranda without importance. Ultimately a journalist anxious to know\n",
      "something of the fate of his 'dear colleague' turned up. This visitor\n",
      "informed me Kurtz's proper sphere ought to have been politics 'on the\n",
      "popular side.' He had furry straight eyebrows, bristly hair cropped\n",
      "short, an eyeglass on a broad ribbon, and, becoming expansive, confessed\n",
      "his opinion that Kurtz really couldn't write a bit--'but heavens! how\n",
      "that man could talk. He electrified large meetings. He had faith--don't\n",
      "you see?--he had the faith. He could get himself to believe\n",
      "anything--anything. He would have been a splendid leader of an extreme\n",
      "party.' 'What party?' I asked. 'Any party,' answered the other. 'He\n",
      "was an--an--extremist.' Did I not think so? I assented. Did I know, he\n",
      "asked, with a sudden flash of curiosity, 'what it was that had induced\n",
      "him to go out there?' 'Yes,' said I, and forthwith handed him the\n",
      "famous Report for publication, if he thought fit. He glanced through it\n",
      "hurriedly, mumbling all the time, judged 'it would do,' and took himself\n",
      "off with this plunder.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thus I was left at last with a slim packet of letters and the girl's\n",
      "portrait. She struck me as beautiful--I mean she had a beautiful\n",
      "expression. I know that the sunlight can be made to lie, too, yet one\n",
      "felt that no manipulation of light and pose could have conveyed the\n",
      "delicate shade of truthfulness upon those features. She seemed ready to\n",
      "listen without mental reservation, without suspicion, without a thought\n",
      "for herself. I concluded I would go and give her back her portrait\n",
      "and those letters myself. Curiosity? Yes; and also some other feeling\n",
      "perhaps. All that had been Kurtz's had passed out of my hands: his soul,\n",
      "his body, his station, his plans, his ivory, his career. There remained\n",
      "only his memory and his Intended--and I wanted to give that up, too,\n",
      "to the past, in a way--to surrender personally all that remained of him\n",
      "with me to that oblivion which is the last word of our common fate. I\n",
      "don't defend myself. I had no clear perception of what it was I really\n",
      "wanted. Perhaps it was an impulse of unconscious loyalty, or the\n",
      "fulfilment of one of those ironic necessities that lurk in the facts of\n",
      "human existence. I don't know. I can't tell. But I went.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I thought his memory was like the other memories of the dead that\n",
      "accumulate in every man's life--a vague impress on the brain of shadows\n",
      "that had fallen on it in their swift and final passage; but before the\n",
      "high and ponderous door, between the tall houses of a street as still\n",
      "and decorous as a well-kept alley in a cemetery, I had a vision of him\n",
      "on the stretcher, opening his mouth voraciously, as if to devour all the\n",
      "earth with all its mankind. He lived then before me; he lived as much\n",
      "as he had ever lived--a shadow insatiable of splendid appearances, of\n",
      "frightful realities; a shadow darker than the shadow of the night, and\n",
      "draped nobly in the folds of a gorgeous eloquence. The vision seemed to\n",
      "enter the house with me--the stretcher, the phantom-bearers, the wild\n",
      "crowd of obedient worshippers, the gloom of the forests, the glitter\n",
      "of the reach between the murky bends, the beat of the drum, regular and\n",
      "muffled like the beating of a heart--the heart of a conquering darkness.\n",
      "It was a moment of triumph for the wilderness, an invading and vengeful\n",
      "rush which, it seemed to me, I would have to keep back alone for the\n",
      "salvation of another soul. And the memory of what I had heard him say\n",
      "afar there, with the horned shapes stirring at my back, in the glow of\n",
      "fires, within the patient woods, those broken phrases came back to\n",
      "me, were heard again in their ominous and terrifying simplicity. I\n",
      "remembered his abject pleading, his abject threats, the colossal scale\n",
      "of his vile desires, the meanness, the torment, the tempestuous anguish\n",
      "of his soul. And later on I seemed to see his collected languid manner,\n",
      "when he said one day, 'This lot of ivory now is really mine. The Company\n",
      "did not pay for it. I collected it myself at a very great personal risk.\n",
      "I am afraid they will try to claim it as theirs though. H'm. It is a\n",
      "difficult case. What do you think I ought to do--resist? Eh? I want no\n",
      "more than justice.'... He wanted no more than justice--no more than\n",
      "justice. I rang the bell before a mahogany door on the first floor, and\n",
      "while I waited he seemed to stare at me out of the glassy panel--stare\n",
      "with that wide and immense stare embracing, condemning, loathing all the\n",
      "universe. I seemed to hear the whispered cry, “The horror! The horror!”\n",

      "“The dusk was falling. I had to wait in a lofty drawing-room with three\n",

      "young--I mean not girlish. She had a mature capacity for fidelity, for\n",
